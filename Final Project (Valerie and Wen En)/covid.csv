1026,@ArchivedGoodies @rayhahn1 @OMAD85793708 @disclosetv We have had vaccines since 1700‚Äôs. mRNA has been studied since 2009 with last CoVid outbreak.

1030,@kwalkerayers @disclosetv counted early on as we did not know for at least two month CoVid causes blood clots hence many heart attacks and stroke deaths we did not attribute to CoVid. So it evens out but still more likely less reported than over reported due to how misinformed we were of all complications
1031,"@disclosetv Don‚Äôt get vax. CoVid will Bwith us 4ever.Each year that passes, ALL of u WILL develop either diabetes, asthma, high blood pressure, cancer etc as will ur loved 1s as WE ALL AGE.

1032,"@mrhodes9 @disclosetv Women in general r more prone 2clotting, women on birth control &amp;/or smoke WAY more prone 2clot then there r our genes such as women has MTHFR homo vs hetero &amp; unless shes miscarried she‚Äôs never know her status-so for women, considering CoVid DOES cause clots, it could be related"
1033,@WI_Ryan_ @disclosetv It‚Äôs killed more than the Spanish Flu at this point. We don‚Äôt realize it as Spanish Flu took over 2years to kill 500K Americans. CoVid escaped the lab-its not behaving like a typical virus. It acts like HIV more than the flu virus &amp; causes neurological damage we don‚Äôt see in flu
1034,"@BigOPumpkin CoVid infection causes blood clots &amp; millions of tiny blood clots that have caused amputation of even young adults &amp; has caused death from stroke &amp; heart attack. CoVid caused clotting overreaction so seems in those prone to it, vaccine can to some extent but not 6 months out."
1035,"@Kathy7KLM @lanacle @disclosetv Long haulers with God knows how long their side effects OF CoVid will last, are being studied all around the world and have been for almost a year once we realized CoVid- which came from a lab- IS unlike any virus we‚Äôve seen aside from HIV &amp; HPV with Neuro LONG TERM side effects"
1036,@Seekingtruth634 @disclosetv My 66 year old mom has not walked in 10 months since CoVid and now she has skin breakdown and infection in bone. CoVid immediately took away her ability to walk due to its effect on her neurological system.
1037,@JonathanHannah @Minnie1114 @disclosetv My mother is 66. She has not walked in 10 months from what CoVid did to her. Prior to CoVid she was driving and independent. It‚Äôs not JUST death- it‚Äôs what it does to the neurons aka nervous system of many.
