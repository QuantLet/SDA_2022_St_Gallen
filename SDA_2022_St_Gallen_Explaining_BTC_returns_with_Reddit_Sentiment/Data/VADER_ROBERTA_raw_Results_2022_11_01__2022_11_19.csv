Everybody can, and should, be moving their bitcoin off exchanges into hard wallets right now, Every non-brain dead bitcoiner knows this.

The point of this post is that, IMHO, Brian Armstrong, Coinbase, Coinbase Pro, and soon-to-be Coinbase Advanced Trade, are corrupted, faulty, bug-ridden, and beyond terrifying to use.  

Unlike with other users, my experience with Coinbase phone support is actually not that bad.  Maybe that’s because I used to buy a lot of bitcoin on Coinbase Pro, and they have a dedicated number for their “special” users….

But boy, special phone number be damned: get the fuck out of there before the forced transition to Coinbase Advanced Trade from Coinbase Pro.  They shaft you with a monthly fee, and the automatic and “easy” one-click transition is a fucking nightmare. 

First, they shut down my Coinbase Pro automatically by pressing that one simple link. Simple my ass….

My Coinbase Pro account was automatically shut down immediately as a result, and I had to wait about four days for the new Coinbase Advanced Trade account to populate with my bitcoin and with my cash.  (I was not, of course, advised that there would be such a delay.)

And then, of course, the bitcoin snd the cash never arrived in the Advanced Trade account, and I was locked out of my Coinbase Pro account. So I had no data to evidence my holdings.  I was screwed.

Fortunately, I finally found screenshots of my old account balances.  That saved the day. 

After about 45 minutes with a Coinbase rep, I was able to move all my money, and all my bitcoin off of Coinbase Pro — which suddenly had all my data again once I complained (even though it was blank before I began the call.). My new Coinbase Advanced Trade still has no data on it….

In my opinion, Coinbase is going to go under, there is something with liquidity, and/or major, technical issues, morale issues, and/or hacking. But damn it, there is something.

But boy, special phone number be damned: get the fuck out of there before the forced transition to Coinbase Advanced Trade from Coinbase Pro.  They shaft you with a monthly fee, and the automatic and “easy” one-click transition is a fucking nightmare. 

First, they shut down my Coinbase Pro automatically by pressing that one simple link. Simple my ass….

My Coinbase Pro account was automatically shut down immediately as a result, and I had to wait about four days for the new Coinbase Advanced Trade account to populate with my bitcoin and with my cash.  (I was not, of course, advised that there would be such a delay.)

And then, of course, the bitcoin snd the cash never arrived in the Advanced Trade account, and I was locked out of my Coinbase Pro account. So I had no data to evidence my holdings.  I was screwed.

Fortunately, I finally found screenshots of my old account balances.  That saved the day. 

After about 45 minutes with a Coinbase rep, I was able to move all my money, and all my bitcoin off of Coinbase Pro — which suddenly had all my data again once I complained (even though it was blank before I began the call.). My new Coinbase Advanced Trade still has no data on it….

In my opinion, Coinbase is going to go under, there is something with liquidity, and/or major, technical issues, morale issues, and/or hacking. But damn it, there is something. 

Get the fuck off of all Coinbase products, and go to something like Strike, then move your buys to a hard wallet. But as to Coinbase: Run!  Run!",-1,,-1,

Bitcoin fixes this. It separates money from the state and takes away the power from banks and politicians. It is designed in such a way that it can last for centuries and resist all sort of attacks. There is no single entity or group of people that controls it. The monetary policy cannot be messed with.

Altcoins (shitcoins) are an attack on Bitcoin because they distract people from the main goal, which is to replace the fiat monetary system. Their narratives rely on attacking Bitcoin (""it's old tech"", ""too slow"", ""has no utility"", ""bad for the environment""), slowing down its overall adoption. 

Most of these altcoins **1)** are scams that exist to enrich its creators, **2)** are centralized (their rules can be easily changed), **3)** solve no real world problems and **4)** are being used exclusively for trading as a way to earn more fiat.

The discovery/invention of Bitcoin cannot be replicated. It solves a problem that took humans thousands of years to solve: Scarce money that cannot be diluted or manipulated by anyone.

 A simple node program for writing and rotating logfile

         $ npm install -g logfile

 The npm command will install a new program on your system called `logfile`

         $ logfile # print the help
         $ echo hello |  logfile - # log hello to stdout

 Basically `logfile` assumes someone is logging to its input stream.
 By default it will stamp all of these log messages with a timestamp and an input type like so

         yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss out (the log message from stdin)

 If the input stream consists of error logs you should use the `-e` option.
 This will replace `out` with `err` in the above example.
 If you think the log is too dull looking you can use the `-c` option to add some colors to it.

 When you start the program you specify a filename you want to log to (use `-` if you want to log to stdout)

         $ logfile myapp.log

 After a while you might want to rotate this log file as it gets bigger.  Using logfile this is simple.
 First move your current log (logfile will keep logging to the moved file).

         $ mv myapp.log myapp.log.backup

 Then find the pid of your logfile process and send `SIGHUP` to it.
 If you used the `-p` pidfile option you can find the pid there.

         $ kill -2 $(cat my-pidfile) # -2 is SIGHUP

Hope everyone is doing great here and thank you for taking the time to read this. I just wanted to share my story for long time now and i think the time has come, 

Some months ago i lost 8 BTC in leverage trading .... i was feeling the worst person on this planet and i had to come up with something to recover but correctly this time. I knew trading was something i really enjoyed doing but i had to learn as i was absolutely wrong with my results.

I managed and i can now say i recovered and not only that, i am in profit as well and feels good. I am not here to promote myself or to sound like i am the best trader or even a good trader. I just want to share my advise to all traders, investors , people who are in here and sometimes things goes wrong because of luck of knowledge, or greediness,  or many other reasons...

Please people always remember 4 rules  before even thinking about making profits and what number will this be : 

1) Sustain what you have is the most difficult task in the long run

2) Make sure if all goes wrong you got money behind you to try again wiser and better

3) Never think of profits and numbers , think of what risk you take and if its worth it

4) Think if you lose that amount of money you are about to invest how long time you need to get it back according to the performance you were expecting from it. 

5) Btc is the most wonderful asset ! ! !

I can assure you this will help you improve all,

I would be very happy to read others experiences as well if you wish,

&amp;#x200B;

Take care ! 

&amp;#x200B;

Hope everyone is doing great here and thank you for taking the time to read this. I just wanted to share my story for long time now and i think the time has come, 

Some months ago i lost 8 BTC in leverage trading .... i was feeling the worst person on this planet and i had to come up with something to recover but correctly this time. I knew trading was something i really enjoyed doing but i had to learn as i was absolutely wrong with my results.

I managed and i can now say i recovered and not only that, i am in profit as well and feels good. I am not here to promote myself or to sound like i am the best trader or even a good trader. I just want to share my advise to all traders, investors , people who are in here and sometimes things goes wrong because of luck of knowledge, or greediness,  or many other reasons...

Please people always remember 4 rules  before even thinking about making profits and what number will this be : 

1) Sustain what you have is the most difficult task in the long run

2) Make sure if all goes wrong you got money behind you to try again wiser and better

3) Never think of profits and numbers , think of what risk you take and if its worth it

4) Think if you lose that amount of money you are about to invest how long time you need to get it back according to the performance you were expecting from it. 

5) Btc is the most wonderful asset ! ! !

I can assure you this will help you improve all,

I would be very happy to read others experiences as well if you wish,

&amp;#x200B;

Take care ! 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Wright’s assertion that he is the inventor of the digital asset – he first sought to prove that he is Satoshi in 2016, months after his name first emerged – has led to a series of legal tussles, some of which are continuing.

But Wright, 52, won nominal damages of £1 after a high court judge ruled that he had given “deliberately false evidence” to support his libel claim.

For cost reasons, McCormack did not offer a defence of truth – where the defendant in the case attempts to show that the allegations are substantially true – as Mr Justice Chamberlain ruled that one claim made in a video discussion on YouTube was defamatory, while a series of tweets repeating the fraud claims were ruled to have caused serious harm to Wright’s reputation.

Need your opinions on the following questions about crypto wallets:

1. When using your current crypto wallet, which step do you think is the pain in the ass? The gas, the seed phrases, or anything else?
2. What made you use a hot wallet for the first time? Is it for a certain project, or just for security concerns?
3. If your friend(new to crypto) asks for your recommendation on hot wallets, which one would you recommend and why? Is the answer still the same if your friend is not new to crypto?

One of the most difficult concepts for people to understand is that, other than knowledge, you do not own anything in the legacy financial system. Seeking fiat wealth is completely pointless and just reinforces the current violence-based system.

Real estate is taxed and can be confiscated. Values can be manipulated by governments and speculators. If war breaks out where you live, you can't take it with you. Same goes for durable goods and precious metals.

***""bUt I hAvE a 401k!!!""***

Stocks, bonds, savings aren't real. Unless you direct register (aka self-custody) your stock shares, you own an IOU. Even then, your accounts can be frozen on a whim of a tyrannical government, or taxed into oblivion. Fiat savings are designed to lose value over time due to inflation and money printing. This whole system is built on lies and the house always wins.

Altcoins are just get rich quick schemes by those looking to fool people who are late(r) to the bitcoin party and have regrets. Hint, there can be an infinite number of altcoins but there will only ever be one bitcoin.

The list goes on. 

Bitcoin on the other hand, when properly self-custodied (NOT on exchanges), is ***yours***. 

It cannot be censored or confiscated (again if properly self-custodied). You can take it with you anywhere in the world when your government fails you. 

It is the first asset (again, other than knowledge), that you can truly own. It represents such a radically different way of thinking that it will take many many years for people to fully understand its implications.

Until then, the corrupt legacy financial system will do everything to try and stop it. Altcoins, futures, negative media, regulations, taxes, etc, will all continue to be deployed against it. The good news is that none of it will work. No one can make more bitcoin. No one can take yours away. All ""they"" can control is the fiat price. Humanity wins when price stops being the end point we collectively seek.

Wake up from the fiat nightmare. Stop caring about price. Bitcoin is so much better for us all.",Bitcoin,Price doesn't matter. Bitcoin offering true ownership does.,1.0,,2022-11-17,11:58:41,"Price doesn't matter. Bitcoin offering true ownership does.Bitcoin is true ownership and represents the only way humans can ***secure wealth without violence.***  

One of the most difficult concepts for people to understand is that, other than knowledge, you do not own anything in the legacy financial system. Seeking fiat wealth is completely pointless and just reinforces the current violence-based system.

Real estate is taxed and can be confiscated. Values can be manipulated by governments and speculators. If war breaks out where you live, you can't take it with you. Same goes for durable goods and precious metals.

***""bUt I hAvE a 401k!!!""***

Stocks, bonds, savings aren't real. Unless you direct register (aka self-custody) your stock shares, you own an IOU. Even then, your accounts can be frozen on a whim of a tyrannical government, or taxed into oblivion. Fiat savings are designed to lose value over time due to inflation and money printing. This whole system is built on lies and the house always wins.

Altcoins are just get rich quick schemes by those looking to fool people who are late(r) to the bitcoin party and have regrets. Hint, there can be an infinite number of altcoins but there will only ever be one bitcoin.

The list goes on. 

Bitcoin on the other hand, when properly self-custodied (NOT on exchanges), is ***yours***. 

It cannot be censored or confiscated (again if properly self-custodied). You can take it with you anywhere in the world when your government fails you. 

It is the first asset (again, other than knowledge), that you can truly own. It represents such a radically different way of thinking that it will take many many years for people to fully understand its implications.

Until then, the corrupt legacy financial system will do everything to try and stop it. Altcoins, futures, negative media, regulations, taxes, etc, will all continue to be deployed against it. The good news is that none of it will work. No one can make more bitcoin. No one can take yours away. All ""they"" can control is the fiat price. Humanity wins when price stops being the end point we collectively seek.

&amp;#x200B;

as the title says, I would like to know some things.. We recently discussed with friends about how it works and even in 3 people we couldn't find answers on some things. Maybe I'm just not good enough in Googling, but I have already browsed Quora, Reddit, some articles, watched some videos and they usually repeat the same things, but usually it is just only surface of how it works or rather what it is.. I even read one book about Bitcoin, but still.. So if you could clarify me a few questions or even some related info would be appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

1)Every 10 minutes there is a new block, which is created by miners, right? I wonder whether all the transactions on the network must wait until a new block is created to be processed?

&amp;#x200B;

2) This follows up the first question... Why when someone pay bigger fee have faster transaction than someone who pay basic fee? There is some limit how many transcations can be processed with one block and you basically compete with your fee against others transcations about priority? So with some big fee transaction will be processed in the next block and with basic fee, it will be processed in like 4th block?

&amp;#x200B;

3) About how mining works.. What determines winner of reward from block.. I read, the first one who will get hash with certain count of zeros in the beginning of hash will win, but does it matters what the rest of hash looks like? Like if 0000kxASDKJ and 0000JKJDMsa can be both winners (sorry for pseudoformat)? Is that winning hash about zeros in the beginning or you must get something more specific?

&amp;#x200B;

4) There is also some thing called difficulty regarding mining. More mining power = bigger difficulty. What makes it more difficult? Requirement of more zeros on the beginning of hash? Like when I want to get more difficulty, I as the network won't require 0000jADSn but 000000maFLEW, because there is lesser likely to guess this hash? Also, why it should be more difficult in the first place?

&amp;#x200B;

5) There are various rewards for each block. Why? It is determined by count of transactions or by sum of the fees paid on transactions? Although as a pool miner I really didn't care about this, it is important for solo miners, but still wondering.",Bitcoin,I still don't get some things about how Bitcoin works,1.0,,2022-11-16,18:15:51,"I still don't get some things about how Bitcoin worksHi there,

I even read one book about Bitcoin, but still.. So if you could clarify me a few questions or even some related info would be appreciated.

1) Every 10 minutes there is a new block, which is created by miners, right? I wonder whether all the transactions on the network must wait until a new block is created to be processed?

2) This follows up the first question... Why when someone pay bigger fee have faster transaction than someone who pay basic fee? There is some limit how many transcations can be processed with one block and you basically compete with your fee against others transcations about priority?

This allows for communication with your companion wallet app (e.g. BlueWallet) using QR codes to receive and send bitcoin, instead of connecting via USB or Bluetooth. Air-gapped transactions can increase the security of your wallet, as you have physical control over when your device receives and sends data instead of being constantly connected like many hardware wallets.

Jade can also now work very similarly to a SeedSigner, by allowing temporary access to a wallet by scanning a SeedQR and forgetting the wallet from your device as soon as you are done using it.

Some of them are:

* US Congress trades
* GitHub Commits
* Wikipedia Views
* Google Trends
* Sentiment on Reddit

I backtested different variations of them on 3-5 years of historical data.

I also calculated benchmarks for them.

I sorted them based on their performance in relation to the benchmark.

The results are below.

It seems that most of those strategies are there simply by chance, if you test a sufficiently large number of strategies some of them will just work.

Some of them definitely don't work, US Congress Members have 45 days to make their trades public.

Some of them are:

* US Congress trades
* GitHub Commits
* Wikipedia Views
* Google Trends
* Sentiment on Reddit

I backtested different variations of them on 3-5 years of historical data.

I also calculated benchmarks for them.

I sorted them based on their performance in relation to the benchmark.

The results are below.

It seems that most of those strategies are there simply by chance, if you test a sufficiently large number of strategies some of them will just work.

Some of them definitely don't work, US Congress Members have 45 days to make their trades public.

I was explaining to my parents that they should get  a hardware wallet to purchase and self custody.  I didn't want to just tell them exactly what to do, I wanted them to feel like they understood. So when they asked what to get, I started walking them through it.

First, choose a wallet that is bip39 compatible.  I got my first ""are you serious?"" look.  But we got past that.  They said, ""ok, so if the wallet is industry standard, then if that wallet breaks and I get another one, I just enter those seed words and I'm fine?""

Hmmm... not exactly.  The new wallet will have to have the same derivation path, or you might not have access to the same addresses.  So I told them to just buy the same wallet.  They asked, what if that one goes out of business? Or if the government bans them and they can't get another HW.  I said, just get a software wallet on your phone.

But then, I started thinking, would that support bip39 with the same derivation path?  

I realized I need to do more research.  And I've owned bitcoin for over a decade...  

My parents were not interested in researching, they just wanted to be done with the conversation.  Everyone buys bitcoin at the price they deserve.  Apparently my parents deserve a future price...

The community really needs to come together and agree on some consistent rules (that will maintain backwards compatibility everywhere) that everyone can feel comfortable with.

From a brief search, I don't even think the bitcoin core software would support importing a ledger or trezor backup mnemonic.

I want to move it to a How wallet, probably Electrum ( Too little BTC for making COLD storage HW practical for now ) but i now have discovered my exchange will charge me 0.0007 BTC for the transfer to my wallet and thats almost 15% of my funds so it doesn't seem like a great idea. 

The good news is, the fees for withdrawal to my local currency is close to $0 so i guess i'll be withdrawing all my funds instead.

And yes, I know that only the size of the memepool matters to you. But mempool size  is very important for my work. I receive a lot of small transactions and regularly collect all coins to one address, paying 1 satoshi for 1 byte of the transaction. Such a low commission allows me to collect coins from 300 exits for only \~ $ 8 at today's rate. But now the mempool has grown and I have to pay 20 satoshi for 1 byte of information, $160 per transaction! Or I will have to wait a very long time for confirmation of my transaction (several days or months).

&amp;#x200B;

I decided to figure out why the mempool grew so much. Looking at the list of transactions, I found thousands of similar transactions: all of them had 100 inputs and 1 output. Output-adress are always the same:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

After exploring the transactions, I came to the conclusion that Binance does the same thing as I do: it collects all the coins from its many addresses to 1 address. but I do it regularly, and binance has a lot of addresses from which it has never collected.

For example, you can take the address

This address has received $5-$30 daily since 2/2/2022. Every day received and never spent until yesterday. And yesterday they started collecting coins from it on bc1qm34lsc65zpw79lxes69zkqmk6ee3ewf0j77s3h. At the same time, I found a addresses not like this one, were regularly replenished, but after 1-3 days everything was transferred from them to bc1qm34lsc65zpw79lxes69zkqmk6ee3ewf0j77s3h. It turns out that Binance regularly collected coins not from all the addresses of they clients, but only from a  part. I admit that this was done so that it would be impossible to analyze how much BTC  Binance have.

It’s like when a murder who helps search for a person they killed? They do it, to make sure they don’t get caught.  


Worse part? Binance cancelled buying FTX due to a possible federal investigation with FTX  - Binance has something to hide. Fact they where willing to entertain the offer knowing FTX was doing shady activity and needed funds, shows they wanted to cover the possible fallout together. 

If Binance had nothing to hide? They would have saved FTX and been crowned the Harrow and foundation of the cryptocurrency leadership.

I'm vaguely familiar with how this works, but have doubts with my small amount of experience.

I was going to send some BTC from Gemini to my Ledger. I put the amount in to send, and Gemini is showing a Receiving address name that I must have put in as a pre-approved address a while back because the name looks like something I would have wrote. However, I wanted to verify that the actual bc1 address shown is a sub address of my xpub so I can verify that I am sending it to my Ledger and not somewhere else.

I searched around the web and here on reddit and nothing I read showed me how to do this. When I went to some of the recommended sites and entered my xpub address from Ledger, I could not see a sub address that matches what I see in Gemini, so I think I might be doing this wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Q2. People say you have to generate a new receive address from Ledger for every receiving transaction, however the exchanges set your whitelist address as the one to always use. So, in order to send to a new address every time from exchange to ledger, that means I have to go through the whitelist address verification process every time, are people actually doing that? Or, when they say use a new receive address every time, they mean every time with a different exchange.

I was looking for a hardwallet. I do know ledger and trezor and my choice would be one of them. This is my situation:
• I only want to store some cryptos for longer-term investment
• Some coins aren’t supported by Ledger but are supported by Trezor

I was looking for a hardwallet. I do know ledger and trezor and my choice would be one of them. This is my situation:
• I only want to store some cryptos for longer-term investment
• Some coins aren’t supported by Ledger but are supported by Trezor

So which one should I buy? And also, which version? Like there is a cheaper and a more expensive one. I’d like to hear the pros and cons for this and why I should buy the cheaper or more expensive one for example.

Thank you in advance!

I also joined recently, for me it was very difficult at the beginning because each exchange (trader side) itself has the feeling that he is the best.   
After a lot of back and forth I decided to go with Kraken, simply because the live support is very accommodating and always available. The fees are also okay for me.

I have also created an account with Etoro and Binance. 

At Etoro I have the attempt of copytrading, of course with S/L (sells as soon as a selected loss or profit is pending). Whether that becomes something, who knows. Since everyone must also decide for themselves whether he has lust for it. Would also be a separate topic.

For storage I have bought a Ledger Nano S. Especially now with the recently known FTX scandal certainly a good idea.

Born out of the financial crisis in 2009, Satoshi gifted us with something never before known to man - Incorruptible, portable, censorship resistant, open, permissionless, trustless, verifiable, unforgeable, digital hard money. 

*A way out.*

Bitcoin gives you something you can *truly* own. Property rights that nobody can take from you or modify the terms of. ***You can choose*** to store generational wealth in your head with just 12 words. ***You can choose*** for your wealth to die with you, *impossible* to recover. 

So then, how did some steal your Bitcoin? Isn't Bitcoin supposed to fix this?

If you lost Bitcoin in the recent exchange collapses, it is because ***you chose*** to have your Bitcoin there. **That is** ***the uncomfortable truth***, and I know it sucks. But let this be a lesson in ***choices***. Bitcoin gives you the inalienable ability to ***choose*** who you trust with your wealth. Next time ***choose*** yourself. 

Take control of your Bitcoin. Take responsibility for it. Take ownership of it. That is where the magic is, and it is what makes Bitcoin special. Don't be tricked into giving those things away to smooth talking charlatans, who promise to make you rich, then steal from you. Opt out.

The reason was, my interpretation to “Not your Keys, not your Coins” meant to me that Coinbase could block my account and deny me from reaching my coins. And personally the risk of having my coins on me was higher than on Coinbase. So I left them there. 

What I recently learned that this term was not explained well enough to me to understand what exchanges were doing, and if I did, I would have weighed the risk much differently. 

Apparently, exchanges were playing the old banks game of selling IOUs, when they don’t even HAVE the coins. Not that my coins are with them and I might be blocked. No, there was no coins to begin with. They were basically “printing” Bitcoins. That was a sudden realization to me. I didn’t know I was buying IOUs. I thought I was buying Bitcoin.

Me not pulling my coins after buying them only helped them play this game even more. And I was part of the problem just as they. 

Now I’m thinking, how did selling IOUs effected the real price/value of Bitcoin. If they were/still are “printing” Bitcoin. They must have affected the price greatly. 

I now also understand the need for regulation. It’s more about regulating this aspect, more than any things else. Unfortunately, most of the regulation we have now is on the buyers side. With ID verification and taxes. We need regulation on exchanges to ensure they are selling something they actually own. 

I want to add one small detail, Coinbase might technically be in a better position than other privately owned exchanges. But still. I wouldn’t make the same mistake even with them.

1. You can’t trust the one who issue your money (in the case of governments printing their own currency into hyperinflation)
2. You can’t trust the one who keep your money (in the case of bank running fractional reserve lending out your money for questionable projects)

What we see in the last few days with FTX is an example of problem #2. Many people talk about this, saying this is why they can’t trust crypto. Few know that their own banks run fractional reserve as well. FTX is said to have 1 billion of reserve against 9 billion of liabilities (people’s money), the reserve ratio is 11.11%.

The legal required reserve ratio for banks in the UK is 12%, 10% for mortgage finance. For US banks, it used to be 3%, now it’s 0%. For Vietnam, it’s 3%. 

What 3% mean is: for every $1000 you keep in your bank, the bank only keep $30 in reserve, they lend out $970 to pocket profit, counting on the fact that not all people will withdraw money all at once.

FTX kept about 11% of reserve and make reckless “investment” on users fund, counting on the hope that most users will keep their crypto on exchanges. Once there was a bank run where many people withdraw at once, they were toasted.

Do you know what your bank reserve % is? Is it better/worse than FTX a month ago?

1. Download Muun Wallet from the App Store. (Any non-custodial hot wallet will do. I like Muun because it’s impossible to mess up and a 5 yr old can use with no directions. 

2. Send your BTC balance there. There is literally only 2 buttons on the whole app. Send and Receive. Can’t mess it up. 

3. Go to Trezor and buy model one ($67) or Model T ($213). Both are open source and pretty comparable. I bought my dad the T since, it’s just slightly better Usability. It will take a week or so to come in. That would be okay, since your funds is safe at Muun or whatever hot wallet you downloaded.

So, it’s optimized for being easy to get started and hard to mess up.

1. Download Muun Wallet from the App Store. (Any non-custodial hot wallet will do. I like Muun because it’s impossible to mess up and a 5 yr old can use with no directions. 

2. Send your BTC balance there. There is literally only 2 buttons on the whole app. Send and Receive. Can’t mess it up. 

3. Go to Trezor and buy model one ($67) or Model T ($213). Both are open source and pretty comparable. I bought my dad the T since, it’s just slightly better Usability. It will take a week or so to come in. That would be okay, since your funds is safe at Muun or whatever hot wallet you downloaded.

*Nothing much to see here, 35 BTC were traded here measured only LocalBitcoins. Monthly value is around 120-140 BTC.*

*There are other exchanges like Binance (king), Reserve and AirTM (and many more), but they don't make public their stats. So I use LocalBitcoin as gauge.*

*Inflation over 140% since January. Which is good for us compared for what we had before.*

*Yes, monthly minimum wage is under 14 USD. It's 130 Bs. (Bolivares) monthly and the exchange rate is 9.3 Bs per USD.*

*Big mining community here as electricity is kinda free.*

I have some questions

   
 

So first of all i never had money on FTX i did make an account like 3 month ago

I dont have any bank accounts linked to id only did KYC

   
 

The thing is this i used the FTX App (Blockfolio) as a Portfolio Tracker

Today i woke up opened the FTX App and it said somethign went wrong so i went to the App Store and made an upgrade and then i opened it again and in the app it made another upgrade

So and like 5 minutes later i went on reddit and yeah so the FTX got ""hacked"" (probably and inside job)

And that you should not make an update wich i saddly did

of course i deleted the app immediatly 

Now i am just a little bit scared that because of the upgrade that i now have a virus/malware on my phone wich can steal my data

I dont use mobile banking only on computer and like i said i never had money on FTX i use other exchanges and hardware wallet still i am a bit worried

The DeFiHorse is a metaverse e-sport game based on Blockchain technology and NFTs, empowering the players and creators to the next level of the horse race.  

The game brings you the gorgeous legendary horses to enter the limitless cyberpunk horserace. Overwhelming yourself in every minute of the battle, using your personal and teamwork skills to earn token rewards, and you will end up with a 1,000,000 dollar prize pool. 

When mankind has not forgotten the myth, Zeus and his brothers murdered and usurped the throne of their father – the Ancient Titan Krono. Suddenly, one day that story is re-enacted in human history more fiercely than ever… 

Four big technology corporations at that time plot to overthrow the global government. For many years, they have been silently researching and monopolizing the most advance technologies: Gene Technology, Quantum Technology, Space-time Technology, Artificial Intelligence Technology. 

When the four major corporations join forces, no government can resist. The whole world witnesses a fierce throne change. 

Four great corporations rule humanity on top of the ivory tower like the four Gods that rule the top of Mount Olympus in the past. Inspired by the myth of Zeus and his brothers, they consider themselves the Gods of the New World. Every big corporation has a dream of hegemony. When there is no one left to fight, they fight each other. The parties are equally talented, victory compensates for defeat, resources and human resources are gradually depleted. 

HOW IT WORKS 

DeFiHorse is a digital horse racing platform. All the in-game assets are represented in selected currency certified by the game platform. In DeFiHorse, the owner need to exchange the currency into DFH tokens to completely control the NFT assets. 

The DFH token is a fungible cryptographic token. A fungible token is one that may be exchanged for other tokens of the same type, so that one DFH token has the same value and properties as any other single DFH token. 

\- DFH is the horse racing games' main utility token and in-game currency. DFH is being used as a cross-title utility and is driving the Play-to-Earn model. 

\- DeFiHorse provides the first reference for how DFH can be used in the ecosystem, with each additional supporting title adding value and utility to the broader DFH ecosystem and the token itself.

It allows borrowers to earn interest on their idle assets, while lenders can generate income from otherwise unproductive assets. The industry has seen explosive growth in recent years, with numerous platforms and services emerging to cater to the growing demand.

Crypto lending platforms typically work by connecting borrowers and lenders through a smart contract. The smart contract defines the terms of the loan, including the interest rate, loan period, and collateral requirements. Once the loan is funded, the borrower can access the funds and begin earning interest. At the end of the loan period, the borrower repays the principal plus interest to the lender.

There are two main types of crypto loans: custodial and non-custodial. Custodial loans are managed by a central platform that holds the assets on behalf of the borrower and lender. Non-custodial loans are managed by a smart contract that doesn’t require a central platform to hold the assets. Non-custodial loans are considered more secure because they don’t rely on a third party to hold and manage the assets.",Bitcoin,What is crypto lending?,1.0,,2022-11-12,06:10:56,"What is crypto lending?[Crypto lending](https://cryptosoftwares.com/crypto-lending-platform/) is the process of loaning out digital assets in return for an interest rate. It allows borrowers to earn interest on their idle assets, while lenders can generate income from otherwise unproductive assets. The industry has seen explosive growth in recent years, with numerous platforms and services emerging to cater to the growing demand.

Crypto lending platforms typically work by connecting borrowers and lenders through a smart contract. The smart contract defines the terms of the loan, including the interest rate, loan period, and collateral requirements. Once the loan is funded, the borrower can access the funds and begin earning interest. At the end of the loan period, the borrower repays the principal plus interest to the lender.

Their demand (supply of dollars) did not contribute to the price of BTC.

Those ""bitcoin"" will disappear (seeing it play out now), but that disappearance does not directly damage the price of Bitcoin, nor adoption.

They weren't contributing to either in the first place. This is poorly understood.

Many victims will finally realise they must hold their own keys. This will lead to a increase of bitcoin held in self custody, and this directly contributes to demand, as the coins are a true portion of the limited 21 million coins.

I've been a bit far from Bitcoin during the last six months due to personal and working troubles...now I'm trying to catch up with the evolution of the base layer and LN during the latest months. 

So I want to ask an open question here: 

What is \*\*the most interesting thing\*\* that happened in the \*\*Bitcoin\*\* (strictly Bitcoin) world that you are really passionate/interested in? 

Name one (or more).

It would be a pleasure if you also provide a source for what you are referring to, in order to let me retrieve all the details.

I have been trying to get my BTC node running for over a month. I have tried running Umbrel OS and MyNode OS on a Raspi 4. Both OS start IBD without a hitch. The next morning when I wake up, IBD has stopped around 15-20% and I can no longer log into MyNode or Umbrel, and can't SSH into them either. 

I have bought an official Raspi power source. I have that plugged into a UPS. I've bought the 32GB Samsung Pro Endurance mSD for the OS. I have tried two different housings and cables for the 1TB WD SSD. I have a dual-fan casing for the Raspi, and temperatures don't rise past 42 C. 

On the networking front, I've assigned a static IP to the Raspi. 

I'm at a loss as to what it can be at this point. It happens every time (10-12x), and to both OS. None of the new hardware I've bought (power source, UPS, new housing, new mSD) have made any difference. What could this possibly be? I'm at a loss.

The awesome oscillator is **a market momentum indicator that compares recent market movements to historic market movements**. It uses a zero line in the centre, either side of which price movements are plotted according to a comparison of two different moving averages.

The Awesome Oscillator (UO) is useful for technical analysis because it takes more standard momentum oscillators and adjusts the calculation in order to strengthen a common weakness among them. However, it really becomes most effective when confirming signals or conditions is identified by additional technical analysis.

**Construction of an Awesome Oscillator**

Understanding the underlying formula used for the construction of the Awesome Oscillator helps traders take prudent decisions while trading in complex scenarios. Calculating the indicator is no longer required as charting platforms and trading software do it for us.

However, knowing how the indicator is calculated will help one better understand the indicator and its strengths and weaknesses. The awesome Oscillator indicator is calculated using the following formula:

The Awesome Oscillator is available on most trading platforms, such as Tradingview and MetaTrader. The indicator is also available on many free online charting sites, such as Investing.com, StockCharts.com, and Yahoo! Finance.

**Working of Awesome Oscillator**• Awesome Oscillator is a histogram consisting of slopes turning from red to green and vice versa.

• Because of its nature as an oscillator, the Awesome Oscillator is designed to have values that fluctuate above and below a Zero Line. The generated values are plotted as a histogram of red and green bars. A bar is green when its value is higher than the previous bar. A red bar indicates that a bar is lower than the previous bar.

• When AO’s values are above the Zero Line, this indicates that the short-term period is trending higher than the long-term period. When AO’s values are below the Zero Line, the short-term period is trending lower than the longer-term period. This information can be used for a variety of signals.

• The common values used are five periods for the fast and 34 periods for the slow.

• As the entry signal, we will take the moment when the histogram’s slopes cross the zero level and change color according to the trade rules.

• The basic principles are the same as with other histograms. The cross of the zero level up indicated the upcoming trend and the cross of the zero level down, the possible reversal to the downtrend.

• Like all technical indicators, it is important to use the AO in conjunction with other technical analysis tools.

**Trading Technique:**

**1 Twin Peaks**

Twin Peaks is a method that considers the differences between two peaks on the same side of the Zero Line. A Bullish Twin Peaks setup occurs when there are two peaks below the Zero Line. The second peak is higher than the first peak and followed by a green bar. Also, very importantly, the trough between the two peaks must remain below the Zero Line the entire time. This is a basic strategy, which looks for a double bottom in the awesome oscillator. This trading technique is much like trading bullish divergence on the histogram below the Zero Line.

**Bullish Twin Peaks Conditions**• The awesome oscillator is below 0• There are two swing lows of the awesome oscillator, and the second low is higher than the first

• The histogram after the second low is green

**Bearish Twin Peaks Conditions**• The awesome oscillator is above 0• There are two swing highs of the awesome oscillator, and the second high is lower than the first

• The histogram after the second peak is red

**2. Crossing Zero Line**When AO crosses above the Zero Line, the short-term momentum is now rising faster than the long-term momentum. This can present a bullish buying opportunity.

When AO crosses below the Zero Line, the short-term momentum is now falling faster than the long-term momentum. This can present a bearish selling opportunity.

**3. Saucer Strategy**

The saucer strategy received its name because it resembles that of a saucer. The setup consists of three histograms for both long and short entries.

**Long Setup Conditions**

• Awesome Oscillator is above 0• There are two consecutive red histograms• The second red histogram is shorter than the first• The third histogram is green

• A trader buys the fourth candlestick on the open

**Short Setup Conditions**• Awesome Oscillator is below 0• There are two consecutive green histograms• The second green histogram is shorter than the first• The third histogram is red

• Trader shorts the fourth candlestick on the open

**Conclusion**• Awesome Oscillators can be useful by applying three trading strategies Twin Peaks, Saucer and Zero Line crossing for buying and selling stocks or any financial instruments.

• AO calculates the difference of a 34 Period and five Period Simple Moving Averages.",Bitcoin,awesome oscillator indicator,1.0,,2022-11-11,05:57:02,"awesome oscillator indicator

Twin Peaks is a method that considers the differences between two peaks on the same side of the Zero Line. A Bullish Twin Peaks setup occurs when there are two peaks below the Zero Line. The second peak is higher than the first peak and followed by a green bar. Also, very importantly, the trough between the two peaks must remain below the Zero Line the entire time. This is a basic strategy, which looks for a double bottom in the awesome oscillator. This trading technique is much like trading bullish divergence on the histogram below the Zero Line.

**Bullish Twin Peaks Conditions**• The awesome oscillator is below 0• There are two swing lows of the awesome oscillator, and the second low is higher than the first

• The histogram after the second low is green

**Bearish Twin Peaks Conditions**• The awesome oscillator is above 0• There are two swing highs of the awesome oscillator, and the second high is lower than the first

• The histogram after the second peak is red

**2. Crossing Zero Line**When AO crosses above the Zero Line, the short-term momentum is now rising faster than the long-term momentum. This can present a bullish buying opportunity.

When AO crosses below the Zero Line, the short-term momentum is now falling faster than the long-term momentum. This can present a bearish selling opportunity.

**3. Saucer Strategy**

The saucer strategy received its name because it resembles that of a saucer. The setup consists of three histograms for both long and short entries.

**Long Setup Conditions**

• Awesome Oscillator is above 0• There are two consecutive red histograms• The second red histogram is shorter than the first• The third histogram is green

• A trader buys the fourth candlestick on the open

**Short Setup Conditions**• Awesome Oscillator is below 0• There are two consecutive green histograms• The second green histogram is shorter than the first• The third histogram is red

• Trader shorts the fourth candlestick on the open

**Conclusion**• Awesome Oscillators can be useful by applying three trading strategies Twin Peaks, Saucer and Zero Line crossing for buying and selling stocks or any financial instruments.

• AO calculates the difference of a 34 Period and five Period Simple Moving Averages.",1,,1,

But I’ve also been seeing more things about running your own node, and that I am not as familiar with.

**The reality of global electric vehicle transition continues to accelerate and I’ve been on the hunt for value and stories of companies that have significant growth in the battery metals and solid state battery space. Battery tech is advancing at a rapid pace and we are seeing disruption in various cell innovations such as Tellurium - Lithium solid state batteries. These superior batteries are getting close to market, specifically the Tellurium - Lithium battery as we see the University of British Columbia developing the next generation of batteries with an EV focus. With the adoption of tellurium cathodes they have been able to supercharge the performance of lithium cells at a disruptive level. Tellurium is extending battery life up to 400% and has shown to hold up to 10 times the charge! The rare metal is used mainly in the solar industry but now that EV battery tech is discovering the virtues of tellurium the demand for this is also soaring with a tight supply. Tellurium already has significant demand from the solar industry and could soon find more demand from this new solid state tech.**

**The resources required to meet all this global battery demand is immense as we can observe right now in the price breakout within lithium and tellurium markets. FENIX Advanced Materials is a supplier of these battery metals for the University of British Columbia’s R&amp;D efforts. I discovered a company that has partnered with FENIX to supply the future demand for this powerful rare metal. The name of it is First Tellurium Corp. and they are the only tellurium focused jr. mining company in North America and possibly globally. They have a 43-101 tellurium resource which is located in west central British Columbia.**

**They also have another property located in Colorado which is showing extremely high grade potential, some of the highest globally as they were the highest encountered in**

[**First Solar**](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FSLR/)**’s nationwide exploration program. This Klondike property eventually ended up in the hands of First Tellurium as it's indicating to be one of the best high grade Tellurium resources in North America. “Surface sampling by First Solar in 2006 found very high tellurium grades of up to 3.3% (33,000 ppm), along with locally high gold grades. Tellurium grades at Klondike were the highest encountered in the company’s nationwide exploration program.”. First Tellurium**[ **recently announced**](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2022/10/13/2533732/0/en/First-Tellurium-Launches-Soil-Sampling-Program-at-Klondike-Project-in-Colorado.html) **that they are conducting soil sampling at Klondike to collect information for optimal drill hole placement for that upcoming drill program.** 

**The BC Deerhorn property already has a PEA which was completed in 2018 and has high gold, silver, tellurium and tungsten grades. They just recently announced news on a significant copper porphyry discovery and a possible 1.1 kilometer extension on that 43-101 Deerhorn resource. The discovery and confirmation of a rare bonafide copper porphyry will increase the value of First Tellurium tremendously! The Deerhorn property was once held by** [**Teck Resources**](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TECK/) **about 40 years ago.**

**CEO of First Tellurium Tyrone Docherty has a strong history in mining as he brought Quinto mining from a $4M dollar company to eventually realize over $1B in monetization for shareholders. Mr. Docherty continues to buy more shares in First Tellurium and is very active with corporate developments and advancing projects. Newsflow has been very strong and is expected to continue into 2023.**

**The share price of First Tellurium seems to be lifting off a bottom here and as we see battery metals breakout to the upside, we can expect the market to soon catch wind of this unique and active junior with such a deep and compelling story. As we see overlooked lithium juniors start to breakout this is an exciting indicator of the sexyness of this story.**

I don't mind paying tax and reporting my holdings but I do mind having my every sat tracked.

We need to start using DEXs and P2P because CEXs give too much data and power to governments and bankers.

Note my opinion is based in part on the fact that in my country (NZ) the only major platform which has come to dominate the entire market, called 'Easycrypto' were literally established by one of the major banks Corporate Strategy Manager and they have gained exclusive banking service from the banks which has been denied to all other platforms which have been obliterated or forced to operate on the margins with very unreliable intermediary banking service. I believe the banks and government only allow platforms they have some control over if not direct influence over as appears the very likely to be the case with Easycrypto.

Not only do CEXs give government and bankers huge access and influence over Bitcoin, they also prevent the development of decentralised DEXs and P2P and that may well be the reason they are allowed- to give the banks and government the ability to track and potentially eventually take control of the protocol.

Plus CEXs have proven totally unreliable and frequently corrupt and incompetent- if we are going to adopt a decentralised currency, don't we need to adopt decentralised trading too?

I am writing here because I want to give you my unwanted opinion about money and the way I see them, I’ve read a lot of books, have a lot of experience on how to deal with your own feelings and I understand them pretty well. I know that everything is psychology and I am here to help you today.

First of all let’s start with that we are born not knowing what money is. When we die we leave everything on Earth.

The more you grow up the more you understand money. The more you understand them the more you want them. The more you want them the bigger risks you take to have them.

Let’s never forget how risky everything is. The moment you have made the decision to take all the risks which brought you to this point you must have realised that this may become your reality. If you did not think that such events would take place, if this is your first bear market or if you thought that it’s not going to happen to you - let me remind you that life is so risky that you don’t even get the chance to get out alive.

Enjoy the experience you are having at this point, take everything as a opportunity, as a lesson, as a goal maker.

I’ll point out a few tips on how to change your life around if you are feeling depressed after these events in the crypto world.

This will be a 5-step guide on how to stop feeling depressed and take control of life back to your hands:

1: Achieve a small win within 2 hours. Anything you know that you have to do. If your room is messy - clean it. Or at least clean a little. Or don’t clean. It’s choice time. At this moment you have the choice to make something in order to chance your future. Everything you do has consequences. If you start with something things will be brighter. But guess what’s gonna be in the next 6 months if you don’t take actions. Just look at the last six. Continue achieving small wins every day to boost your confidence.

2. Set a goal. What do you want? Is it something achievable? Have you asked for it? Have you tried doing what you can towards the goal and leave things that are out of your control for a later stage? The problem of you not having the amount of money inside your bank account is because you don’t have a goal. A specific one, on paper.

Tip: set a goal, set the timeframe in which should be accomplished(specific date), write down the plan for achieving it, tell yourself exactly what amount of money you want in you bank account(specific amount). These steps are very important. You should write down everything and read it out loud every evening and every morning before and after bed. The most important thing here is to imagine it. Feel as if you have already achieved that goal. Imagining things turn them into their material equivalent.

Start working with what you’ve got. Everything else will come into place sooner or later.

3. Put a fake smile on your face and believe that you are happy. Keep that smile until you are truly happy. Be kind to everyone, compliment random people, show them respect, remember their names when meeting them. This will bring you new friends. It will bring you a lot of happy faces and good times. Making people feel valuable makes them give back the good feelings. 

4. Think of yourself as of the better version of you you want to become. Think as if you already have the money you want to possess. If you wanna be a millionaire think of you as if you are one. 

5. “You are the major key of your better future.” Write that down and make sure you read it everyday.


These things basic rules have made me a millionaire. I firstly acquired the mindset then everything else came into place. Everything that stops you from the billionaires is the mindset. And the speed. Do not try to find excuses. Before I became a millionaire I’ve had a list of 50 excuses of why am I not rich and none of them was “me” as a reason. And I’ve lived month for month waiting for my salary to arrive. 

You can become the better version of yourself if you start changing things today. Or stay in the same hole as before by not taking actions. You see you cannot change the weather when it’s raining.

I know things seem really hard right now, and I won't pretend to have a crystal ball that can offer any comfort for an unknown future—but for what it's worth I will offer a few patterns I've recognized over the years, as well as a few personal beliefs which have developed as a result of said patterns:

1) If you've invested in BTC then you're someone who has joined a community without borders. There are so many good people here who have weathered so very much. There's value in this community alone. 

2) There's a rigged game/system, and that game ignored BTC, mocked it and treated it like an annoying fly—until it couldn't—and then that rigged system jumped in with both feet because that system is filled with opportunists, not creators. I believe it's those opportunists who are creating a lot of BTC's stumbling blocks as it grows.  

3) There's BTC, and then there's Crypto—one is a movement, the other is largely spillover from the rigged system trying to capitalize on something it can never create. 

4) I've been through days like yesterday and today at least a few dozen times. Without fail trolls will do everything they can to mock you for investing/believing in BTC. It can hurt and cause doubt, absolutely—but remember their trolling mostly happens on obvious red days. That's a clear sign of no courage. Which leads me to the last thought I'd like to share....

5) Courage isn't a singular point—sometimes it takes courage to cash out your BTC because it makes sense for your life situation—some times it takes courage to admit you over-leveraged yourself in purchasing BTC and are now in a tough spot—hell, it takes courage to read legitimate critiques of BTC if you're heavily invested—and finally, it takes courage to hodl on days like these, even if you believe in BTC in the longterm. 

To that end—and this is gospel truth—it absolutely takes zero courage to drop by r/bitcoin to mock hodlers or believers. 

None. 

The shit talking and mocking is going to happen. Unfortunately there are miserable people in the world who love looking for an opportunity to make others miserable as well. They too have a community, and within that community is cannibalism—not a shared belief in something a human-culture changing as BTC. 

So, when you come across some small person trying to dunk on you for your beliefs and the research you've done, or for your desire to exit out of a corrupt system—revert back to this:

* [Innovations being built on L3](https://medium.com/coinmonks/bitcoin-layer-3-and-its-latest-rise-e80e64c32dd6) are starting to begin and this could be massive for privacy among other ideas.

Bitcoin is like Michael Jordan, The GOAT, but he doesn't play in the NBA.

No he plays in a Rec League at the YMCA, with every jabroni that can put on a tank top.

To watch him play, you don't get a nice seat, with parking and concessions and merchandise to buy

You get to stand on the sidelines, in a gym with no A/C, and watch a hundred clowns run around, like chickens with their head cut off, try and play with him. They can't play defense, they're stupid, they are horrible athletes, and they miss 90% of their shots, but they act like they are really playing the game well. They think this is time well spent, doing something productive

This is what ""crypto"" is to the average person, looking at it from the outside in.  These are the sh!tcoiners, playing with Jordan.  Jordan is just trying to get a sweat, stay in shape until he can get into the NBA.

It would also be analogous to Muhammad Ali, when he was exiled for 3 years from boxing, and he had to make speeches, stay in the gym, do an exhibition here and there, to stay ready for reinstatement into the professional world.

The world sees this Crypto circus, this storm of thievery and stupidity, from bad exchanges to  snake oil salesman VCs, pumping-and-dumping sh!tcoins, swirling around this space, saying they are the next Bitcoin, and they average Joe is supposed to separate the wheat from the chaff?

Bitcoin is tarnished by the company it keeps.  Guilty by association.

Bitcoin and ""Crypto"" are two very different things.  Like Jordan in the Rec league.

The outside world would never know it.  They think we are all on the same team, playing the same game.  That's the problem with Bitcoin.  

It's not Bitcoin.  It's us, acting like chimps around it. The optics are horrible.

Not Bitcoin's fault, but this is the lot, the ghetto, Bitcoin lives in.

We have to bring Bitcoin out of it, out of the darkness of ""Crypto"", and into the light.",Bitcoin,Bitcoin explained perfectly (Response to FTX Explained perfectly),1.0,,2022-11-09,12:18:21,"Bitcoin explained perfectly (Response to FTX Explained perfectly)[https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/yq7qa7/ftx\_explained\_perfectly/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/yq7qa7/ftx_explained_perfectly/)

I'm new to cold storage and still trying to familiarize myself with all the details. I've used exchanges so far. (robinhood, voyager, ftx) Feels like I've managed to make every mistake possible, but still lucky enough not to have lost anything to the exchanges. Earlier today I finally got around to moving my bitcoin from ftx to my ledger. I went through the whole process of setting up the ledger and whatnot for the first time. It was easier than I thought it would be and I'm glad everything is in cold storage and not on the exchanges anymore. I'm feeling pretty relieved right now!

Going forward I plan on buying with strike and sending to my ledger. I did a test and sent a small amount of bitcoin from strike to ledger. About 40 cents worth of bitcoin, but then in ledger live the transaction shows there was a fee of about $2.40. So I'm confused what exactly the fee is. I thought with strike there would be no fee. I'm assuming the $2.40 fee is a mining/gas fee? (not really sure if those are the right terms) I thought that was avoided because strike uses the lightning network. Or is it a fee that ledger live is charging me?

Is there a way to avoid or reduce this fee when I send bitcoin from strike to ledger?

And then in the future if I wanted to move bitcoin from the ledger back to strike is there going to be another similar fee and can it be avoided?

&amp;#x200B;

Right now I just use bitcoin as an investment/store of value. I don't plan on selling for the foreseeable future. In the future if I want to start using it for daily purchases, say something small like a drink at the gas station, how would you recommend going about that? Say I get something like the strike card. I don't think it's released yet, but this is a hypothetical. So I use my strike card to pay for a 99c can of arizona tea. Is strike going to pass along a $2.40 gas/mining fee to the gas station because I bought the tea?

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I'm trying to get a better understanding of how it all works when it comes to fees. Hopefully this all makes sense. Any info you have that can clear things up for me would be great! thanks!",Bitcoin,Questions about using strike with a ledger nano s and fees...,1.0,,2022-11-08,18:38:48,"Questions about using strike with a ledger nano s and fees...Okay so a little backstory.

And one of the most talked about topics on this subject is CBDC (central bank digital currency). In my opinion, the reason why cryptocurrencies have not yet been massively adopted is because many people just don't care about the factors of autonomy, freedom, and feel perfectly comfortable with the Central Bank and the Government managing their financial life.

However, it is inevitable that CBDC will bring limitations in these aspects that these same people have never cared about before, and can slowly begin to understand the importance of Financial autonomy. CBDC is not being created aimlessly, be sure of that.

My logic follows a similar pattern to successful products in the tech industry. To be successful, you need to sell a product that solves problems that people didn't know they had, and CBDC can make people realize that these problems do exist, and look for alternatives that they never cared before.

Remember the times of 2020-2021, at that time the direction of “earnings from an IPO” was very popular, you probably noticed that no one is talking about it now.

An IPO is an initial public offering of shares. In times of cheap money, many companies wanted to profitably sell their share of the business.

Approximately 60% of the shares of IPO companies are traded -50% from the moment of placement.

Another \~25% of these stocks have already fallen -70-80%.

The fact is that IPOs were carried out by unprofitable companies or those that had just begun to receive a small profit.

Under the current conditions, no one needs such shares.

That is, the topic of IPO is relevant only at times when the Fed is printing money on the market, investors are willing to take risks.

The IPO ETF peaked at +250% and then dropped by -80%.

**👀 How are the other sectors doing?**

In the days of the active printing press, ETF Ark Innovation was popular.

Asset manager Cathy Wood was very popular for a period.

Her stock fund grew by +340% at the moment, and fell by -100% a year later.

That is, all growth was lost as soon as the Fed turned off the printing press.

**🇺🇸 What about American indices?**

The Sp500 rose +100% and then lost -17%.

The Nasdaq Tech Index rose +115% and then shed -25%.

The Russell 2000 Index - which tracks the assets of 2,000 small-cap US companies rose +130% and fell -20%.

**💵 What about crypto?**

Since the launch of the printed stone, Bitcoin has grown by +800% - the absolute leader in terms of profitability. True then lost -65%.

♻️ **Outcome**:

There is not much time left for central banks before the launch of the new printing press.

It will probably happen in December-January.

Market cycles tend to repeat themselves and this makes our work very easy.

Based on the attached picture, we can conclude that at the start of a new bull market, Bitcoin will be the strongest asset, since it will bring the greatest profitability in the next bull cycle.

In the second stage of the bull cycle (end period), it is better to sell Bitcoin and shift to the Sp500 and Nasdaq indices.

Now you know what to do and what to buy in the market.

I know someone that is struggling with an old bitcoin core wallet from pre-seed phrase days. They are unable to authorise any outgoing transactions when loading the wallet.dat file into a freshly set up copy of bitcoin core. This wallet has not been active since at least 2017 and the password has not been changed (I/they are certain of this as the wallet wasn't touched at all immediately following a transaction back then). This password worked previously but now they cannot get it to accept with modern bitcoin core. 

 I know that 99% of the time these things boil down to 'oh darn, turns out I did change the password after all', but here's the thing; the wallet is encrypted with a password in Russian Cyrillic. I read somewhere that Cyrillic letters can require some different kind of decryption, however my contact has successfully used this password many times up to 2017, at which point they stopped using the wallet and have been unsuccessful in accessing it since \~2020. 

Are there any known issues with Cyrillic denoted passwords and modern versions of bitcoin core, and could this be remedied by downloading an older (circa 2016/17) version of core? They have incredibly slow internet so attempting this would take over a month and I don't want to waste their time. 

I'd be happy to provide further details/try replicating any fixes with a blank wallet if anyone has suggestions.

Many thanks in advance.",Bitcoin,Technical question on old bitcoin core USB wallets,1.0,,2022-11-08,14:53:48,"Technical question on old bitcoin core USB walletsHi all,

Anyone that believes FTX failing has any impact on bitcoin's long-term future doesn't understand bitcoin, IMO.

When Bear Stearns and Lehman crashed were pundits calling for the collapse of the value of a Dollar in the long-term.

There were short-term implications on assets during the financial crisis.

And after a sizable accumulation, I withdraw from FTX to my hardware wallet, for free.

 Now, with all the FTX rumours, have withdrawn all BTCs from FTX to my hardware wallet and don't want to use it anymore, atleast till things get clearer. 

What is the potential way forward for me, for weekly withdrawal? I could think of some options below:

1. Withdraw that 50k sats directly to my hardware wallet weekly. Drawback: Too many addresses with smaller balances which is both tough to maintain and also later will have to pay fees to withdraw from each.

2. Withdraw that 50k sats directly to my hardware wallet weekly but use the same address. Drawback: As people say, this reduces privacy. But still I am not very clear what privacy I am losing. The exchange am withdrawing from already knows my address(es) irrespective of it is same or different. Others looking at the blockchain may know I am DCAing. What others they can know? Why not I use the same address, I don't quite get that part.

3. Withdraw that 50k sats to my Muun wallet - different address every week and withdraw from Muun to hardware wallet after a sizable amount. Drawback: While withdrawing from Muun to hardware wallet, Muun too charges cumulative fees to withdraw from each address. This am not sure. This would be the preferred option if fees is not a lot.

4. Withdraw to Muun on same address every week. - if fees for option 3 is a lot, then trade off privacy and withdraw weekly to same address. Once moved a bunch to hardware wallet, start using a new Muun address.

Crypto currency is an elusive map to follow, with endless forms of scrutiny that has left much to be desired. Of late, there are roughly 30,000 crypto coins that investors can choose from, but only a handful of companies have emerged to become leading sectors of this industry. The econometric difficulties forecasting the value of digital assets has given investors a bright future---as with levels of uncertainty there is equal levels of hope. Though predicting the patterns of the crypto currency market is one that even Morgan Stanley professionals have incorrectly predicted, many still tease out various technical indicators in hopes to ultimately quantify the correct direction of the market. Many crypto enthusiasts have been long awaiting the end of the bearish cycle of 2022 and will be relieved to end the crypto winter once and for all. 

On November 6th 2022,  the very first indication of the end of bearish cycle appeared. In this brief repot, we will discuss the various reasons behind the end of the bearish cycle and quantify the bullish direction that the market has awaited.

“The trend is your friend, until the end,” is a common theme in any general market. To this end, we have ignored specific digital asset companies, whether good or bad, and have evaluated the market in its entirely. To approach this type of generalization, we used a simple metric of ***total market capitalization of all crytpo companies*** to date in order to evaluate the correct direction of the market trend.

Market capitalization can be defined the price of each token (or representative company) by the number of circulating coins. This is a powerful tool to utilize as it encompasses the broad market value and allows for various degrees of freedom (macro-micro economical data) in the general market direction.

It is important to note that in any direction that the entire crypto market follows, whether bullish or bearish, the **crypto market capitalization has always been crossed by THREE respective moving averages. (5, 13, 8)**

For example, around November 21st, 2021, the market capitalization was breached significantly by the 13, 8, and 5 day moving average, indicative of a downward trend. Likewise, a bearish pattern was still indicated in August 2022 *as not all three bands were breached* (green band never breached). 

We can not stress the importance of all three bands effectively breaking their moving averages, whether in an upward or downward direction to predict the trend of the market.

*Green band 13 day moving average*

*Black band 8 day moving average*

*Pink band 5 day moving average*

Similar crossover market pattern was identified on November 6th 2022 for the first time since the early bearish reversal last year.  The 5 day, 8 day, and 13 day bands have all been crossed in a positive direction as of date. This signifies an important trend reversal for the first time since August 2021 in the bullish direction. 

The unique structure of cryptocurrency incurs much speculation and uncertainty. Nonetheless, given the  **loyalty of millions of investors** in this arena, and **the relentless work crypto software engineers and miners**, it would **benefit investors to continue their due diligence**, and stem the possibility that finally our crypto bull market is underway.

It is important to note that in any direction that the entire crypto market follows, whether bullish or bearish, the **crypto market capitalization has always been crossed by THREE respective moving averages. (5, 13, 8)**

For example, around November 21st, 2021, the market capitalization was breached significantly by the 13, 8, and 5 day moving average, indicative of a downward trend. Likewise, a bearish pattern was still indicated in August 2022 *as not all three bands were breached* (green band never breached). 

We can not stress the importance of all three bands effectively breaking their moving averages, whether in an upward or downward direction to predict the trend of the market.

*Green band 13 day moving average*

*Black band 8 day moving average*

*Pink band 5 day moving average*

Similar crossover market pattern was identified on November 6th 2022 for the first time since the early bearish reversal last year.  The 5 day, 8 day, and 13 day bands have all been crossed in a positive direction as of date. This signifies an important trend reversal for the first time since August 2021 in the bullish direction. 

The unique structure of cryptocurrency incurs much speculation and uncertainty. Nonetheless, given the  **loyalty of millions of investors** in this arena, and **the relentless work crypto software engineers and miners**, it would **benefit investors to continue their due diligence**, and stem the possibility that finally our crypto bull market is underway.

Though this article is not financial advice, as a dentist and professional, I truly believe the power of digital assets, and feel very confident the bullish crypto market is well underway.",1,,1,

##### AUSTIN - Texas became the first state in the United States to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender this weekend in a surprise announcement made by Governor Greg Abbott on Sunday. 

##### In an unanticipated development, the Texas House of Representatives voted 90 to 60 in favor of the Sound Money Act of 2022 which adopted Bitcoin as the only acceptable form of legal tender within the state. Following the House’s passage of the law, the Texas State Senate followed suit later in the day in a 20 to 11 vote, with Gov Abbott quickly signing the bill into law afterward. 

##### Gov Abbott touted the use of Bitcoin for its potential to allow Texans to send remittances to family members living in other states being affected by the dollar’s continued devaluation.

##### At a press conference held Sunday afternoon, Gov Abbott is quoted as saying “Texans need a reliable and censorship resistant way to easily store and transact value and frankly going with Bitcoin was a no brainer.”

##### In a boon to firms like Ledger and Trezor, the state of Texas allocated funds to provide a stipend to low &amp; middle income Texans for a hardware wallet. At the press conference held on Sunday, Texas House Speaker, Dade Phelan, spoke to this point saying “it will be critical that Texans self-custody their Bitcoin if we are going to create monetary independence for our state.”

The banner says - cannot use credit cards for this transaction. But I am not trying to make a transaction. I am trying to link paypal.

What changed? When I go to payment methods and try to add paypal it just loads a form to plug in a debit card. Is paypal just not really a thing with coinbase anymore? I just don't understand why it wants me to add a card when trying to link paypal.

Plus the banners are confusing. There is a banner at the top that says cannot use credit card for this transaction.

But then below there is a banner that says add debit or credit card below. But it won't take a card. I like to use a credit card when buying btc because it's instant and I can send instantly and not wait 8 days.

How it works?

We will use a Script which changes the timezone of our browser whenever we make a new order on G2A. As soon as we get redirected to the payment page, our timezone will change, which will result in our order getting market as “Expired” on G2A’s payment processor called “Bitbay”, but not on G2A’s side itself. So, if we pay for the products - our order will get processed and delivered by G2A anyway, but money will get INSTANTLY refunded to our wallet by Bitbay.

Important

This Script does not work with every Country if u need a specific country dm me.

Make sure you got the notification at the top and press ok otherwise it will not work.

Bitbay will refund your expired order only if it’s above 0.002 BTC. Any lower amount is not prioritized by their refund system and will not work.

Basically you have to add to your cart products that are worth at least 0.002 BTC in total, it could be one or multiple products.

Okay, let’s begin.

Here are the things you need:

\- At least 0.002 BTC (50$) to pay for the order.

\- Tampermonkey extension: [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey)

\- A Script that changes the Timezone. [https://textbin.net/raw/ktbrhzmfrz](https://textbin.net/ktbrhzmfrz)

Okay if ready follow my steps:

1. Click on Tampermonkey’s icon and click “Create a new script.”
2. Remove any preset code
3. Copy the script:

[https://textbin.net/raw/ktbrhzmfrz](https://textbin.net/ktbrhzmfrz)

And paste it in the Editor from Step 2

4. Go to “File” and click “Save”.

5. Go to [https://www.g2a.com/](https://www.g2a.com/) and add products to your cart.

Example: $100 Amazon Giftcard.

Insert your e-mail address and click “Go to payment”.

6. Now choose BTC (Bitbay). Then click “Continue”.

7. Now pay for the products by sending BTC to the address displayed, its important that it is the address and not the QR code as it is the wrong timezone with the QR code.

Once you pay for the order just wait for 1 confirmation in the blockchain. Shouldn’t take longer than 15 minutes, then you will receive an email from G2A and your btc will be refunded.

Note:This is a REPOST I am NOT the Original Creator of this and I did asked the Creator for permission.

ORIGINAL: [https://www.reddit.com/user/XenomMethod/comments/yjflby/g2a\_refund\_method\_2022\_november/](https://www.reddit.com/user/XenomMethod/comments/yjflby/g2a_refund_method_2022_november/)

How it works?

We will use a Script which changes the timezone of our browser whenever we make a new order on G2A. As soon as we get redirected to the payment page, our timezone will change, which will result in our order getting market as “Expired” on G2A’s payment processor called “Bitbay”, but not on G2A’s side itself. So, if we pay for the products - our order will get processed and delivered by G2A anyway, but money will get INSTANTLY refunded to our wallet by Bitbay.

Important

This Script does not work with every Country if u need a specific country dm me.

Make sure you got the notification at the top and press ok otherwise it will not work.

Bitbay will refund your expired order only if it’s above 0.002 BTC. Any lower amount is not prioritized by their refund system and will not work.

Basically you have to add to your cart products that are worth at least 0.002 BTC in total, it could be one or multiple products.

Okay, let’s begin.

Here are the things you need:

\- At least 0.002 BTC (50$) to pay for the order.

\- Tampermonkey extension: [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey)

\- A Script that changes the Timezone. [https://textbin.net/raw/ktbrhzmfrz](https://textbin.net/ktbrhzmfrz)

Okay if ready follow my steps:

1. Click on Tampermonkey’s icon and click “Create a new script.”
2. Remove any preset code
3. Copy the script:

[https://textbin.net/raw/ktbrhzmfrz](https://textbin.net/ktbrhzmfrz)

And paste it in the Editor from Step 2

4. Go to “File” and click “Save”.

5. Go to [https://www.g2a.com/](https://www.g2a.com/) and add products to your cart.

Example: $100 Amazon Giftcard.

Insert your e-mail address and click “Go to payment”.

6. Now choose BTC (Bitbay). Then click “Continue”.

7. Now pay for the products by sending BTC to the address displayed, its important that it is the address and not the QR code as it is the wrong timezone with the QR code.

Once you pay for the order just wait for 1 confirmation in the blockchain. Shouldn’t take longer than 15 minutes, then you will receive an email from G2A and your btc will be refunded.

I'm not new and I look into Bip39 12 words + passphrase when it came out! I upgraded my cold storage wallet recently. I pulled out my Polaroid picture from my old safe with 12 words + Passphrase I took the day I upgraded to the Bip39 standard. Nothing is wrong with the picture! I've entered the phrase correctly! The picture is of my cold storage device before I accepted and finalized the input!

I go to do research and all I get is you mis typing it or I forgotten the passphrase! That's impossible because I have the photograph! I have my old account with all my funds clearly visible to see. it hasn't been hacked it's all there but with out my old device to sign off on I can't spend anything anymore... 

I was told that you can infact change devices with this new system. 

I think Bip39 is flawed at recovering the same account under the passphrase option! 

I see many people that swears they made no mistakes having the same issues. 

I'm starting to believe that Bip39 w/passphrase is not only flawed but may infact have issues at the coding level. 

I ran Btcrecovery and exhausted all possible solutions. Nothing is getting my cold storage accounts back. 

Can anyone give me an idea about what had happened?  were there changes to the protocol I don't know about? 

any idea of what could have gone wrong would be appreciated.

Learn about cryptography; learn about the actual system then we will speak another time. I m an expert in it... I will explain you something in this comment.  

For the divisibility, if BTC comes to be use for 5% of the world wealth 65 trillion $ it we be above 154 millions dollar/BTC, 65 000 000 000 000 000 \* 0.05 / 21 000 000 = 154 000 000$  but you will not be able to trade by 1.5$ step (1 satochi) it s insufficient divisible... If half of the world wealth enter in BTC it will be 15$ steps... It miss 4 or 5 zero or units more... It s not so well thinked...

Than the big difference with precious metals is that BTC have an open register, and you can know how many BTC are in a wallet just with the wallet address... Crazy?! Yes for long distance transaction is interesting but not for saving and less and less for daily transaction... That make a useful price of BTC between 3000 to 5000$, down the energy cost for mining, so... RIP

BTC today is the typical image of an absurd comportement autodestructor... 

There is more and more problem but you can't say what you just say. Make the calculation by yourself with the hashrate for the enormous BTC electric consumption just today, than think. There is different cryptocurrencies and many are less efficient than BTC using a ton of electric power for nothing... (a part of 2.0 Ponzy sheme) 

Listen that please : 

Bank use few cryptography because they have their own intranet. And you know why? Why they didn't use cryptography? Why did they build an intranet for them? Because cryptography use too many energy!!!! They knows it! BTC technology isn't new!!!

For me cryptography is a nuclear button of internet. It can destroy it. But one thing is sure, Cryptography is destroying our real world for any utility. 

Stop walls (cryptography) and make bridges (open source). Interne tis a virtual world we don't need walls or money in it, we need to understand it. Internet is like a universal and free library it have to be free. If printing machine was kept in the church hands for Bible our world will be really different no? Crypto and internet is near the same. Don't change internet for an undispensable monster it's just a library, not a selling place or publicity medium...

I understand that fiat money has made this inequality worse because of credit expansion and asset bubble that follows it.

I don't want to get all political, but I've been following the situation in UK where the new PM is a guy with 700M net worth. Let that sink in. To my knowledge, the policies he is proposing is mostly benefiting the rich, small tax cuts for regular people, bigger ones for the wealthy. I see this same thing happening everywhere where the game which is being played is sort of class-warfare against the working people. The kind of thing Chomsky is raving about. I think that once the majority of the population realizes that they've been screwed by the policies and lobbying(read corruption) there will be calls reforms. While I like bitcoin for the idea that it's censorship-free and permissionless, I also see it as a problem in terms of inequality. Wealthy people have the cash flow to scoop up bitcoin and slowly escape to a realm where you can not re-distribute the wealth evenly amongst people. It really does worry me. I know the situation right now is bad, but it doesn't mean that re-distributing wealth amongst people would be impossible.

I might be in the minority here with these statements and owning BTC would mean that I would also benefit from this realm shift, but I don't feel as it is morally the ""correct"" thing to do.

Anyway, take this as you will and would love to get some feedback on my thoughts.

I see in Sparrow where I can create a new wallet, but this makes it seem like the private key is then on my computer (I'll explain more why I may be missing a key piece of understanding below).

I also see where I can add the signing devices and the scheme (2-of-3, 3-of-5, etc) and saw a video on using PSBT exports and imports where those devices become the multi-signatures required to move.

Is there a way to confirm the address shown in Sparrow is a multi-sig using my Umbrel node (via Mempool in the Umbrel)? This would help reassure me that even if the private key from Sparrow is on the PC (and backed up) that it's not a ""normal"" hot wallet since it requires mutli-sig to move.

Is it more like Ledger Live where Sparrow has the wallet, but the private keys are on the devices themselves (and not on the PC)? If so, do I just set up those other devices like I would if they were regular cold storage 1-of-1 devices with addresses and 24 words backed up as normally done then later essentially link them together in Sparrow as 2-of-3 for example?

I also see multi-sig detail export from Sparrow in a few different formats so you can properly reconstruct the multi-sig setup if your computer were wiped/crashed.

Using 24-words you can backup with steel/metal, but is there a preferred way to back this multi-sig info? Is that safe for something like cloud storage and an SD card in a safe or something like that to prevent a fire taking out your computer and the backup)? I'm assuming it's alright to back this multi-sig file up in multiple less secure places as it's not the actual private keys or given it's multi-sig?

In sparrow when you create this new address and set it up as a multi-sig, going back to the standalone 24-word backups for signing devices, how would I backup this Sparrow address or is there no real backup since it creates no private key and those keys instead reside on the signing devices and they're backed up as you normally would backup a wallet there?

Since you'd have an address then on each signing device (2), what happens if you send btc to those addresses instead of the Sparrow address? Does it just behave like 3 different addresses where one of the 3 requires multi-sig?

I think I'm somewhat close to understanding this, but really would like to get a better grasp of what's happening under the hood so to speak and want to make sure the backup process is sound as well as my understanding of the flowchart of how this works.

I've tried to find videos, but not sure they quite go into the nuances I'm trying to learn or figure out in this (perhaps I'm more fundamentally missing something and a piece of information missing would make it click for me).

Thanks for any help trying to clarify some of these gaps in understanding for me and sorry if some of this seems basic, but want to understand it a little more before setting it up (will still test with small amounts first). Don't have many offline I associate with that could assist with this sort of nuanced topic and aren't any meetups in the area unfortunately.

There is a couple of sentences in the paper but I cannot understand how this can happen.  
I have some knowledge of blockchain but nothing specific about how bitcoin works, so I figure maybe one of you has an idea.  
The sentences are the following:

Ultimately, the most important parties regarding governance are the Bitcoin miners. These miners run the Bitcoin network by executing software, and they decide whether to run a new version of the Bitcoin protocol by means of upgrading their software. In case sufficient miners decide not to run the newest (or: a competitive version), and the newest version relaxes the protocol, a hard fork occurs, which in worst case results in a new currency.

[https://twitter.com/BitcoinNDaily/status/1588176449856368641?s=20&amp;t=bZvNyyw0tNv5pur5L4wvbA](https://twitter.com/BitcoinNDaily/status/1588176449856368641?s=20&amp;t=bZvNyyw0tNv5pur5L4wvbA)

Before I post my idea, I'd like to highlight some key factors that affect how powerful a symbol is, monetarily and culturally speaking. A strong symbol:

* Speaks to the meaning of what it represents, often in multiple/different ways.
* Must be distinguishable, even if the differences between it and others are subtle.
* Ideally, especially for a currency symbol, it needs to be easily replicable/written/expressed.
* ""Less"" is often ""more""; K.I.S.S (keep it simple stupid).

Of the two ideas put forward by **Sat Symbol** and **Bitko Yinowsky**, I must say I prefer the former, as it perfectly marries together the ideas that while [satoshis are bountiful, abundant, plentiful](https://satsymbol.com/), the total number of bitcoin is inexorably approaching the limit ([Unicode character ≐ U+2250](https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/U+2250)). Having said this, a currency symbol IMO derives its practicality from how easily/quickly it is written. I am concerned that nocoiners will find it alien, or simply ""too much effort"" to write out (I know, its pedantic, but a consideration nonetheless).  
Which is why I appreciate Bitko Yinowsky's symbol, as it's already very familiar looking and legible. However, people have pointed out that the ""@"" symbol is not expressed consistently in other countries, who's cultures may apply different pronunciations/attribute different meanings to the ""@"" symbol, which presupposes that the symbol only really ""clicks"" with English native-speakers.

As I said, I took inspiration from both ideas, as they both have merit. So here's my (albeit crude) symbol submission:

* Bitcoin's symbol is the capital letter ""B""; not to say the satoshi symbol must be comprised of the letter ""s"", but it certainly maintains continuity.
* The legible-flow of the letter ""s"" is in keeping with the ""stacking sats"" mantra; DCA, DCA, DCA.
* The diagonal through the middle of the ""s"" is similar to the Sat Symbol (丰), and connects the ""s"" together, reminiscent of the **infinity symbol ∞**:
   * Under hyperbitcoinization, everything will be priced in terms of bitcoin (∞/21M)
   * Every 10 minutes, billions of satoshis ebb and flow across the network, like an infinity stream.
* Besides infinity, the diagonal also makes the ""s"" look like the number 8; as most bitcoiners know, satoshis are fractions of a bitcoin expressed to eight decimal places; one bitcoin is 1.00000000 BTC, or 100,000,000 satoshis. The symbol provides a mental-anchor point, subconsciously reminding users how many decimal places satoshis are expressed, in terms of whole bitcoins.
   * For countries that use dollars and cents, the latter ""cents"" comes from the latin ""centum"" meaning ""hundred""; One dollar is made up of 100 cents, with dollars and cents fully expressed to two decimal places, e.g. $3.50.
* To nocoiners, this symbol is reminiscent to the dollar symbol ""$""; English speaker or ESL (English as Second Language), the dollar is entrenched in our collective international psyche.  
(Although, however similar it is, I hope you agree that it is distinct enough!)

Had I had full-access to Adobe Illustrator (as I do normally), I could've rendered a much higher quality version, however for the purposes of sharing the initial idea, Paint sufficed.

I hope to encourage critical discussions, creative thinking, and above all the idea that nothing is determined for us already; we are all clearly so early in the overall bitcoin adoption cycle. Bitcoin as a protocol is open source, and is strong because of it; I'd like to think all aspects of Bitcoin can remain open and accepting to thoughtful discourse, as who knows what new uses Bitcoin will address beyond its use as a SoV/UoA, and it's ability to transfer wealth across time and space.

Cheers.",Bitcoin,Sat symbol idea,1.0,,2022-11-04,14:35:58,"Sat symbol ideaThe following Satoshi symbol idea was inspired by the work already done by the preeminent [Sats Symbol](https://twitter.com/SymbolSatoshi) and the newly introduced satoshi symbol of combining an ""s"" and the ""@"" symbol by [Bitko Yinowsky](https://twitter.com/BitkoYinowsky); their symbols were recently shared in a tweet by [Bitcoin New Daily](https://twitter.com/BitcoinNDaily) in the following post:  
[https://twitter.com/BitcoinNDaily/status/1588176449856368641?s=20&amp;t=bZvNyyw0tNv5pur5L4wvbA](https://twitter.com/BitcoinNDaily/status/1588176449856368641?s=20&amp;t=bZvNyyw0tNv5pur5L4wvbA)

Before I post my idea, I'd like to highlight some key factors that affect how powerful a symbol is, monetarily and culturally speaking. A strong symbol:

* Speaks to the meaning of what it represents, often in multiple/different ways.
* Must be distinguishable, even if the differences between it and others are subtle.
* Ideally, especially for a currency symbol, it needs to be easily replicable/written/expressed.
* ""Less"" is often ""more""; K.I.S.S (keep it simple stupid).

Of the two ideas put forward by **Sat Symbol** and **Bitko Yinowsky**, I must say I prefer the former, as it perfectly marries together the ideas that while [satoshis are bountiful, abundant, plentiful](https://satsymbol.com/), the total number of bitcoin is inexorably approaching the limit ([Unicode character ≐ U+2250](https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/U+2250)). Having said this, a currency symbol IMO derives its practicality from how easily/quickly it is written. I am concerned that nocoiners will find it alien, or simply ""too much effort"" to write out (I know, its pedantic, but a consideration nonetheless).  
Which is why I appreciate Bitko Yinowsky's symbol, as it's already very familiar looking and legible. However, people have pointed out that the ""@"" symbol is not expressed consistently in other countries, who's cultures may apply different pronunciations/attribute different meanings to the ""@"" symbol, which presupposes that the symbol only really ""clicks"" with English native-speakers.

As I said, I took inspiration from both ideas, as they both have merit. So here's my (albeit crude) symbol submission:

Bitcoin is money and money does not have many uses other than being money. It's a worthless paper without any other utility or an entry in a database. That being said, money is one of the most important inventions we ever made and modern civilization could not exist without it, Money is only useful for financial uses: that means it is either a medium of exchange, a store of value of an unit of account. It's boring but very important. Money is a &gt;$100 trillion market and Bitcoin can fill some niches within this market and capture a smaller or bigger percentage of it. Whether people use it as digital modern version of gold, as a decentralized saving account, remittances, as an alternative to banking where banking is not available, protect themselves against hyperinflation of their local currencies or against corrupt regimes, or just add it to their investment portfolio to diversify all of these are legitimate uses of bitcoin for which there will always be  a certain demand.

**Bitcoin is a zero sum game therefore it can't be an investment**

A lot of things people invest in are zero sum investments. Gold, art, wines, currencies, commodities, derivatives. options, futures are all examples of zero sum investments some of which have existed for hundreds or thousands of years.

**Bitcoin does not have an intrinsic value therefore the market value is zero**

 A lot of things that people invest in don't have an intrinsic value. Gold, art, collectibles and fiat currencies don't have any intrinsic value and yet they have a constant value above zero.

**Bitcoin consumes as much energy as an entire country.**

This argument is often used by journalists trying to manipulate their readers. Why use country but not compare them to the energy consumption of other things? Video gaming and tumble dryers consume as much energy as Bitcoin but no one perceives them as energy wasting. Country is used because people perceive countries as huge but they perceive gaming or dryers as small and insignificant sources of energy consumption.

In reality Bitcoin uses only 0.1% of global energy worldwide a fairly insignificant number. Cattle farming is estimated to generate 15% of global greenhouse emissions, 100x more than Bitcoin and yet some people seem to be feel far more threatened by Bitcoiners instead of meat eaters.

**Bitcoin can't scale**

This does also imply that because Bitcoin can't scale now it never will. The truth is that while the base layer has  a limited TPS capacity, Bitcoin doesn't need to perform all it's transactions on the first layer so claiming that Bitcoin as a technology can never scale would also assume that no building on second layers will ever happen which is of course contradicted by the fact that efforts are being made build on second layers. As demand for transactions go up there is an incentive to build more capacity on other layers of the network.

**Bitcoin is too volatile**

This does also imply because Bitcoin is volatile now it will always be that volatile. There is no reason to believe volatility in Bitcoin is constant. Volatility is  a reflection of market maturity. 2012 Bitcoin was far more volatile than 2022 Bitcoin and that trend to lower volatility will continue.

The company’s BTC holdings are currently incurring around 50% unrealized loss over the total investment made to purchase Bitcoin. Last week’s surge in Bitcoin (BTC) price came as a much needed relief to investors in the midst of the ongoing bear market rally.

However, the current range is way below the crypto market prices registered during last year’s bull run. A large section of Bitcoin investors are still trading in losses thanks to the prolonged bearish momentum in 2022.

The company’s BTC holdings are currently incurring around 50% unrealized loss over the total investment made to purchase Bitcoin. Last week’s surge in Bitcoin (BTC) price came as a much needed relief to investors in the midst of the ongoing bear market rally.

However, the current range is way below the crypto market prices registered during last year’s bull run. A large section of Bitcoin investors are still trading in losses thanks to the prolonged bearish momentum in 2022.

A lot of people don't know about this crypto buying method.

P2P method is the method of buying crypto directly using your local currency from the sellers across the country. I will try to simplify the method using screenshots from Binance P2P Page. We are going to consider two persons : Person A and person B. P2P method is extremely useful in third world nations like India, where banks restrict the fiat deposit in Crypto exchanges.

So, the entire process looks like this.

1. ⁠Let's say person A wants to buy 100 USDT via P2P. So, he will go to Binance P2P page, where he can scrolll through and find sellers ready to sell the required amount of USDT for INR based on local currency rate. 1$ is around 86 INR. The rates shown below are also based on supply and demand.
2. Let's assume that ⁠Person B is selling 100 USDT via P2P on the binance. He has created a sell order for 100 USDT with a price of 1 USDT for 88 INR. A is interested in this order. So, he clicks on B's sell order buy option (green). The bank details are mentioned by B in his sell order. Whenever a person creates a sell order, Binance will freeze his corresponding assets and acts as an escrow. 
3.  Person A after entering the fiat amount, and pressing the Buy USDT option; an order is created by the binance. Now, A has to transfer the Fiat amount (8800 INR in the example) to B, using the bank transfer method mentioned by B.
4. Person A transfers the amount to B, and after getting the confirmation from both, A and B regarding the transaction, Binance will transfer the frozen USDT from B's wallet to A's wallet and the P2P transaction gets completed.

&amp;#x200B;

In the case where there is any issue in the transaction or disputes between the parties, binance will act as a middlemen; After going through the proofs submitted by both the parties, a conclusion is reached. for ex: If the buyer didn't sent any amount and lied that he did, Binance will ask for the proof of transaction, failing to provide will lead to temporary deactivation of account.

So, here, Binance simply acts as an escrow and no fiat amount is transferred from or to Binance. So, banks can see that person B transferred some fiat amount (10k INR in our example) to person A, but they can't find out the reason of transfer, and hence, they can't block or restrict this transaction.

As the transfer is between person A and person B, and Binance just acts as an escrow, it is known as peer-to-peer or person-to-person (P2P) facility.

In case of any doubts, please ask in the comments.

 Yemen is the home of the worst humanitarian crisis on the planet as result of the war, corruption and the deadly siege imposed by the Saudi-led coalition since 2015. According to UN reports, there are 19 million Yemenis suffering from food insecurity.  

But, thanks to the generous donations we received in Bitcoin, we were able to break the siege and overcome orgs corruption by providing food packages for more than 550 families and installed 5 water tanks in 5 neighborhoods. 

Unfortunately, due to the continuation of the siege, lack of humanitarian aid, unemployment, poverty and high prices, the situation is going worse day by day.  

Now, we're trying to help 200 families who are struggling everyday to find a meal, by providing them with food packages.  

Each food package costs 83$, that can lasts for about a month. 25 kilos of flour. 10 kilos of rice. 4 liters of oil. 8 cans of beans.

First, I’m only interested in Bitcoin and not the other aspects of cryptocurrency.

If I understand, the idea is that Bitcoin could replace all other currencies and a quick Google shows that there is somewhere around $6 trillion of hard currency in the world.  Also, I believe that there will be at most 21 million Bitcoins ever minted so if Bitcoin replaces all currency each coin should be worth at least $250,000.  That all makes sense. 

So if I buy some Bitcoin today am I supposed to spend it or save it until it hits $250,000 and then start spending it?

I believe that transaction fees are around $1 so If I buy a $10 item at a store the fee is still $1?  That’s too high for small purchases so should I only use it for larger purchases.  But for larger purchases I currently use a credit card or write a cheque.

I don’t understand how I’m supposed to use Bitcoin like cash with fees that high and then if I spend it and the value goes up to $250,000 then I’ve lost a lot of potential.  Really the question is if everyone hodls and no one spends Bitcoin how is it supposed to replace other currencies?

I believe that transaction fees are around $1 so If I buy a $10 item at a store the fee is still $1?  That’s too high for small purchases so should I only use it for larger purchases.  But for larger purchases I currently use a credit card or write a cheque.

I don’t understand how I’m supposed to use Bitcoin like cash with fees that high and then if I spend it and the value goes up to $250,000 then I’ve lost a lot of potential.  Really the question is if everyone hodls and no one spends Bitcoin how is it supposed to replace other currencies?

It’s all a bit confusing.",1,,-1,

The author interviews Richard Dennis, one of the most succsessfull traders ever. He was one of the few relevant democrats in the investment sector, a world that was dominated by republicans, and he was heavily intellectually invested in politics. This was written more than 30 years ago and it feels more relevant than ever.

&amp;#x200B;

**As a long-time market observer, what major trends do you see shaping up over the coming years?**

I bet we will be at record levels of inflation by the end of 1990. It is going to be driven by trying to avoid a deep recession. The recession is going to be caused by the federal budget deficit as investors require higher and higher levels of real interest rates to buy the debt. The' government will try to avoid the recession by stimulating the economy, a tactic which essentially doesn't work. 

It is, unfortunately, a very Republican idea, but I think it is right. Whether you like it or not, the financial markets are in conservative hands. People who lend money to the government and business will not buy monetary easing as a solution to a recession.

**Are you implying that the deficit problem is just a time bomb, which will eventually shatter the economy?**

Sure. We tend to think that since it is not a problem now, that means it won't be. We expect continuity in our lives, but the economy, and certainly the markets, are more discontinuous than continuous.

It is like having termites in the foundation of your house. You may not notice them until one day they gnaw away a big chunk and the house collapses. I don't think anybody should take a large amount of comfort in the fact that things appear to be holding together.

**Hypothetically, if you were President and could influence change, would the deficit be the first thing you would change?**

Sure. I think it is especially important for Democrats, since they were the first ones to pick up the banner of Keynesianism \[the advocacy of government programs to increase employment\], to admit that while it may be a great theory, it doesn't work in the real world.

**I don't think Keynes ever proposed using deficit spending in strong economic times.**

No, that's true. He proposed surpluses that were supposed to be countercyclical to deficits. Surpluses in good times; deficits in bad times. The trouble is that we have only one side of that equation because of the lack of political will to create the surpluses when times are good. So what we really ought to do is admit that Keynesian economics is just an excuse for easy money, overspending, and overconsuming. We ought to just admit that the government is a debt junkie and the whole concept of deficit spending is flawed in practice.

**You mean Keynesianism as it is being applied, not Keynesian economics as he himself purported it?**

The theory is fine, it just doesn't work in the real world. Therefore, we shouldn't use it. Besides, Keynesian economics was a solution to the problem of oversaving and underconsumption, which was a fair enough attempt to pull us out of the Great Depression. The problem now is the exact opposite: undersaving and overconsumption. Even if Keynesianism were politically tenable, you still need a different solution because you have the exact opposite problem.

**Is there an economic theory that you feel fits the times and makes sense?**

We have to get rid of deficit spending. We need to retire the deficit in some orderly way, and the federal government should have to balance its budget just as the states do. At that point, Milton Friedman's proposal for a constant money supply adjusted by a growth factor would probably be a good idea.",Bitcoin,Keynesianism doesn't work in the real world.,1.0,,2022-11-02,10:47:04,"Keynesianism doesn't work in the real world.This is from the Market Wizards book (Jack Schwager,1988).

&gt;A 29-year-old man swept away by currents dies on Condado beach

&gt;A 29-year-old man died Friday morning after being swept away by sea currents on the beach behind Ashford Hospital in County, the Police Bureau said.

&gt;According to a police report, the incident was reported at 9:15 a.m. when authorities were alerted that the man, identified as Nicolai Arcadie Muchgian, had been dragged.

&gt;Rescue personnel managed to rescue his body that no longer showed vital signs, it was reported. 

&gt;According to the authorities, the injured party was a resident of San Juan. 

&gt;Agent Rosario, assigned to the Isla Verde Tourist Precinct, was in charge of the complaint.

&amp;nbsp;

Now here is where it gets strange.  

Leading up to his death, Nikolai began to send out cryptic tweets.  

These are a few tweets that I found since September.  

I'm sure I missed a few.
