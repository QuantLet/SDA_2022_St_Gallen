2022-10-10," Colleagues, good afternoon,
You
know that yesterday Chairman of the Investigative Committee Alexander Bastrykin     Bastrykin AlexanderChairman of the Investigative Committee of Russia 
reported to me on the first results of the investigation into the act of sabotage on the Crimean Bridge. 
The forensic and other expert data, as well as operational information, show that
the October 8 explosion was an act of terrorism aimed at destroying Russia's
civilian and critical infrastructure.
It
is also clear that the Ukrainian special services were the organisers and perpetrators of the attack. The Kiev regime has long been using terrorist
methods, including murders of public figures, journalists and scientists, both
in Ukraine and in Russia. And terrorist attacks on towns in Donbass, which have
been going on for more than eight years. And also acts of nuclear terrorism, by which I mean missile and artillery strikes on the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power
Plant.
This
is not the whole story: Ukraine's special services have also carried out three
terrorist acts against Russia's Kursk Nuclear Power Plant, repeatedly blowing
up the plant's high-voltage lines. The third such terrorist attack damaged
three of those lines at once. The damage was repaired in the shortest possible
time and there were no serious consequences.
However,
there have been a number of other terrorist attacks and attempts to commit
similar crimes against electricity generation and gas transportation infrastructure facilities in our country, including an attempt to blow up a section of the TurkStream gas pipeline system.
All
this has been proven by objective data, including the testimony of the detained
perpetrators.
It
is well known that Russian representatives are not allowed to take part in the investigation into the causes of explosions at and the destruction of international gas pipelines running under the Baltic Sea. But we all know who
ultimately benefits from this crime.
Thus,
the Kiev regime, by its actions, has actually put itself on the same level as international terrorist groups, and with the most odious of those. It is simply
no longer possible to leave crimes of this kind without retaliation.
This
morning, at the proposal of the Defence Ministry and in accordance with the plan of Russia’s General Staff, a massive strike was launched with long-range
precision air, sea and land-based weapons against Ukrainian energy, military
and communications facilities.
In the event of more attempts to stage terrorist attacks on our territory, Russia's
response will be harsh and commensurate with the threats posed to the Russian
Federation. Nobody should have any doubts about that.
 Defence Minister, please report on the results.
"
2022-09-21,"Friends,
The subject of this address is the situation in Donbass and the course of the special military operation to liberate it from
the neo-Nazi regime, which seized power in Ukraine in 2014 as the result of an armed state coup.
Today I am addressing you – all citizens of our
country, people of different generations, ages and ethnicities, the people of our great Motherland, all who are united by the great historical Russia, soldiers,
officers and volunteers who are fighting on the frontline and doing their
combat duty, our brothers and sisters in the Donetsk and Lugansk people’s
republics, Kherson and Zaporozhye regions and other areas that have been
liberated from the neo-Nazi regime.
The issue concerns the necessary, imperative
measures to protect the sovereignty, security and territorial integrity of Russia and support the desire and will of our compatriots to choose their
future independently, and the aggressive policy of some Western elites, who are
doing their utmost to preserve their domination and with this aim in view are
trying to block and suppress any sovereign and independent development centres
in order to continue to aggressively force their will and pseudo-values on other countries and nations.
The goal of that part of the West is to weaken,
divide and ultimately destroy our country. They are saying openly now that in 1991 they managed to split up the Soviet Union and now is the time to do the same to Russia, which must be divided into numerous regions that would be at deadly feud with each other. 
They devised these plans long ago. They
encouraged groups of international terrorists in the Caucasus and moved NATO’s
offensive infrastructure close to our borders. They used indiscriminate
Russophobia as a weapon, including by nurturing the hatred of Russia for decades, primarily in Ukraine, which was designed to become an anti-Russia bridgehead.
They turned the Ukrainian people into cannon fodder and pushed them into a war
with Russia, which they unleashed back in 2014. They used the army against
civilians and organised a genocide, blockade and terror against those who
refused to recognise the government that was created in Ukraine as the result
of a state coup.
After the Kiev regime publicly refused to settle the issue of Donbass peacefully and went as far as to announce its ambition
to possess nuclear weapons, it became clear that a new offensive in Donbass –
there were two of them before – was inevitable, and that it would be inevitably
followed by an attack on Russia’s Crimea, that is, on Russia.
In this connection, the decision to start a pre-emptive military operation was necessary and the only option. The main goal
of this operation, which is to liberate the whole of Donbass, remains
unaltered.
The Lugansk People’s Republic has been
liberated from the neo-Nazis almost completely. Fighting in the Donetsk
People’s Republic continues. Over the previous eight years, the Kiev occupation
regime created a deeply echeloned line of permanent defences. A head-on attack
against them would have led to heavy losses, which is why our units, as well as the forces of the Donbass republics, are acting competently and systematically,
using military equipment and saving lives, moving step by step to liberate
Donbass, purge cities and towns of the neo-Nazis, and help the people whom the Kiev regime turned into hostages and human shields.
As you know, professional military personnel
serving under contract are taking part in the special military operation. Fighting
side by side with them are volunteer units – people of different ethnicities,
professions and ages who are real patriots. They answered the call of their
hearts to rise up in defence of Russia and Donbass. 
In this connection, I have already issued
instructions for the Government and the Defence Ministry to determine the legal
status of volunteers and personnel of the military units of the Donetsk and Lugansk people’s republics. It must be the same as the status of military
professionals of the Russian army, including material, medical and social
benefits. Special attention must be given to organising the supply of military
and other equipment for volunteer units and Donbass people’s militia. 
While acting to attain the main goals of defending Donbass in accordance with the plans and decisions of the Defence
Ministry and the General Staff, our troops have liberated considerable areas in the Kherson and Zaporozhye regions and a number of other areas. This has created a protracted line of contact that is over 1,000 kilometres long.
This is what I would like to make public for the first time today. After the start of the special military operation, in particular after the Istanbul talks, Kiev representatives voiced quite a positive response to our proposals. These proposals concerned above all
ensuring Russia’s security and interests. But a peaceful settlement obviously
did not suit the West, which is why, after certain compromises were
coordinated, Kiev was actually ordered to wreck all these agreements.
More weapons were pumped into Ukraine. The Kiev
regime brought into play new groups of foreign mercenaries and nationalists, military units trained according to NATO
standards and receiving orders from Western advisers. 
At the same time, the regime of reprisals
throughout Ukraine against their own citizens, established immediately after
the armed coup in 2014, was harshly intensified. The policy of intimidation,
terror and violence is taking on increasingly mass-scale, horrific and barbaric
forms. 
I want to stress the following. We know that
the majority of people living in the territories liberated from the neo-Nazis,
and these are primarily the historical lands of Novorossiya, do not want to live
under the yoke of the neo-Nazi regime. People in the Zaporozhye and Kherson
regions, in Lugansk and Donetsk saw and are seeing now the atrocities
perpetrated by the neo-Nazis in the [Ukrainian-] occupied areas of the Kharkov
region. The descendants of Banderites and members of Nazi punitive expeditions
are killing, torturing and imprisoning people; they are settling scores,
beating up, and committing outrages on peaceful civilians. 
There were over 7.5 million people living in the Donetsk and Lugansk people’s republics and in the Zaporozhye and Kherson
regions before the outbreak of hostilities. Many of them were forced to become
refugees and leave their homes. Those who have stayed – they number about five
million – are now exposed to artillery and missile attacks launched by the neo-Nazi militants, who fire at hospitals and schools and stage terrorist
attacks against peaceful civilians. 
 We cannot, we have no moral right to let our kin
and kith be torn to pieces by butchers; we cannot but respond to their sincere
striving to decide their destiny on their own.
The parliaments of the Donbass people’s
republics and the military-civilian administrations of the Kherson and Zaporozhye regions have adopted decisions to hold referendums on the future of their territories and have appealed to Russia to support this.
I would like to emphasise that we will do
everything necessary to create safe conditions for these referendums so that
people can express their will. And we will support the choice of future made by the majority of people in the Donetsk and Lugansk people’s republics and the Zaporozhye and Kherson regions. 
Friends,
Today our armed forces, as I have mentioned,
are fighting on the line of contact that is over 1,000 kilometres long,
fighting not only against neo-Nazi units but actually the entire military machine
of the collective West.
In this situation, I consider it necessary to take the following decision, which is fully adequate to the threats we are
facing. More precisely, I find it necessary to support the proposal of the Defence Ministry and the General Staff on partial mobilisation in the Russian Federation to defend our Motherland and its
sovereignty and territorial integrity, and to ensure the safety of our people
and people in the liberated territories. 
 As I have said, we are talking about partial
mobilisation. In other words, only military reservists, primarily those who
served in the armed forces and have specific military occupational specialties
and corresponding experience, will be called up.
Before being sent to their units, those called
up for active duty will undergo mandatory additional military training based on the experience of the special military operation.
I have already signed Executive Order on partial mobilisation.
In accordance with legislation, the houses of the Federal Assembly – the Federation Council and the State Duma – will be
officially notified about this in writing today.
The mobilisation will begin today, September 21. I am instructing the heads of the regions to provide the necessary
assistance to the work of military recruitment offices. 
I would like to point out that the citizens of Russia called up in accordance with the mobilisation order will have the status, payments and all social benefits of military personnel serving under
contract. 
Additionally, the Executive Order on partial
mobilisation also stipulates additional measures for the fulfilment of the state defence order. The heads of defence industry enterprises will be directly
responsible for attaining the goals of increasing the production of weapons and military equipment and using additional production facilities for this purpose.
At the same time, the Government must address without any delay all aspects of material, resource and financial support for our defence enterprises. 
Friends,
The West has gone too far in its aggressive
anti-Russia policy, making endless threats to our country and people. Some
irresponsible Western politicians are doing more than just speak about their
plans to organise the delivery of long-range offensive weapons to Ukraine,
which could be used to deliver strikes at Crimea and other Russian regions. 
Such terrorist attacks, including with the use
of Western weapons, are being delivered at border areas in the Belgorod and Kursk regions. NATO is conducting reconnaissance through Russia’s southern
regions in real time and with the use of modern systems, aircraft, vessels,
satellites and strategic drones.
Washington, London and Brussels are openly
encouraging Kiev to move the hostilities to our territory. They openly say that
Russia must be defeated on the battlefield by any means, and subsequently deprived
of political, economic, cultural and any other sovereignty and ransacked. 
They have even resorted to the nuclear
blackmail. I am referring not only to the Western-encouraged shelling of the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant, which poses a threat of a nuclear disaster, but
also to the statements made by some high-ranking representatives of the leading
NATO countries on the possibility and admissibility of using weapons of mass
destruction – nuclear weapons – against Russia.
I would like to remind those who make such
statements regarding Russia that our country has different types of weapons as well, and some of them are more modern than the weapons NATO countries have. In the event of a threat to the territorial integrity of our country and to defend
Russia and our people, we will certainly make use of all weapon systems
available to us. This is not a bluff.
The citizens of Russia can rest assured that
the territorial integrity of our Motherland, our independence and freedom will
be defended – I repeat – by all the systems available to us. Those who are
using nuclear blackmail against us should know that the wind rose can turn
around.
It is our historical tradition and the destiny
of our nation to stop those who are keen on global domination and threaten to split up and enslave our Motherland. Rest assured that we will do it this time
as well.
 I believe in your support.
"
2022-04-21," I believe it
would be inadvisable to storm this industrial zone.
I order you to cancel it.
 This is the case when we have to prioritise preserving the lives and health of our soldiers and officers. Of course, this is our constant priority, but even more so in this case. There is
no need to penetrate these catacombs and crawl under these industrial
facilities.
Seal off the industrial zone completely.
 You must offer all those who have
not laid down their weapons to do so. Russia guarantees them their lives and dignity as per the relevant international legal instruments. All the wounded
will get medical assistance.
You successfully completed the combat effort to liberate Mariupol. Let me congratulate you on this occasion, and please convey my congratulations to the troops. I am also asking you to submit proposals on bestowing state decorations on the service personnel who distinguished
themselves. Of course, as usual, there will be various decorations, but I want
everyone to know that they are all heroes for us and for all of Russia. 
In this context, we need to make sure that we
fulfil all the social commitments to our service personnel, especially the wounded
and the families of our fallen comrades.
However, I believe that this would not be enough.
We have to do more and come up with additional support measures, and in some
case to consider ways of perpetuating the memory of those of our comrades who
displayed heroism and sacrificed their lives so that our people in Donbass live
in peace and to enable Russia, our country, to live in peace. These people
deserved this by what they did and the way they honoured their oath.
I am asking you to work on this matter within
the Defence Ministry, while I will issue the corresponding instructions to the Presidential Executive Office. I will talk to my colleagues in the regions, and they will work with the municipalities across Russia.
Assuming control over Mariupol, a major city in the south of the country, is obviously a success. Congratulations.
"
2022-02-24,"Citizens of Russia, friends,
I consider it necessary today to speak again
about the tragic events in Donbass and the key aspects of ensuring the security
of Russia.
I will begin with what I said in my address on February 21, 2022. I spoke about our biggest concerns and worries, and about
the fundamental threats which irresponsible Western politicians created for Russia consistently, rudely and unceremoniously from year to year. I am
referring to the eastward expansion of NATO, which is moving its military
infrastructure ever closer to the Russian border.
It is a fact that over the past 30 years we
have been patiently trying to come to an agreement with the leading NATO
countries regarding the principles of equal and indivisible security in Europe.
In response to our proposals, we invariably faced either cynical deception and lies or attempts at pressure and blackmail, while the North Atlantic alliance
continued to expand despite our protests and concerns. Its military machine is
moving and, as I said, is approaching our very border.
Why is this happening? Where did this insolent
manner of talking down from the height of their exceptionalism, infallibility
and all-permissiveness come from? What is the explanation for this contemptuous
and disdainful attitude to our interests and absolutely legitimate demands?
The answer is simple. Everything is clear and obvious. In the late 1980s, the Soviet Union grew weaker and subsequently broke
apart. That experience should serve as a good lesson for us, because it has
shown us that the paralysis of power and will is the first step towards
complete degradation and oblivion. We lost confidence for only one moment, but
it was enough to disrupt the balance of forces in the world.
As a result, the old treaties and agreements
are no longer effective. Entreaties and requests do not help. Anything that
does not suit the dominant state, the powers that be, is denounced as archaic,
obsolete and useless. At the same time, everything it regards as useful is
presented as the ultimate truth and forced on others regardless of the cost,
abusively and by any means available. Those who refuse to comply are subjected
to strong-arm tactics.
What I am saying now does not concerns only
Russia, and Russia is not the only country that is worried about this. This has
to do with the entire system of international relations, and sometimes even US
allies. The collapse of the Soviet Union led to a redivision of the world, and the norms of international law that developed by that time – and the most
important of them, the fundamental norms that were adopted following WWII and largely formalised its outcome – came in the way of those who declared
themselves the winners of the Cold War.
Of course, practice, international relations
and the rules regulating them had to take into account the changes that took
place in the world and in the balance of forces. However, this should have been
done professionally, smoothly, patiently, and with due regard and respect for the interests of all states and one’s own responsibility. Instead, we saw a state of euphoria created by the feeling of absolute superiority, a kind of modern absolutism, coupled with the low cultural standards and arrogance of those who formulated and pushed through decisions that suited only themselves.
The situation took a different turn.
There are many examples of this. First a bloody
military operation was waged against Belgrade, without the UN Security Council’s
sanction but with combat aircraft and missiles used in the heart of Europe. The bombing of peaceful cities and vital infrastructure went on for several weeks. I have to recall these facts, because some Western colleagues prefer to forget
them, and when we mentioned the event, they prefer to avoid speaking about
international law, instead emphasising the circumstances which they interpret
as they think necessary.
Then came the turn of Iraq, Libya and Syria. The illegal use of military power against Libya and the distortion of all the UN
Security Council decisions on Libya ruined the state, created a huge seat of international terrorism, and pushed the country towards a humanitarian
catastrophe, into the vortex of a civil war, which has continued there for years. The tragedy, which was created for hundreds of thousands and even
millions of people not only in Libya but in the whole region, has led to a large-scale exodus from the Middle East and North Africa to Europe.
A similar fate was also prepared for Syria. The combat operations conducted by the Western coalition in that country without
the Syrian government’s approval or UN Security Council’s sanction can only be
defined as aggression and intervention.
But the example that stands apart from the above events is, of course, the invasion of Iraq without any legal grounds.
They used the pretext of allegedly reliable information available in the United
States about the presence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. To prove that
allegation, the US Secretary of State held up a vial with white power, publicly, for the whole world to see, assuring the international community that it was a chemical warfare agent created in Iraq.
It later turned out that all of that was a fake and a sham, and that Iraq did
not have any chemical weapons. Incredible and shocking but true. We witnessed
lies made at the highest state level and voiced from the high UN rostrum. As a result we see a tremendous loss in human life, damage, destruction, and a colossal upsurge of terrorism.
Overall, it appears that nearly everywhere, in many regions of the world where the United States brought its law and order,
this created bloody, non-healing wounds and the curse of international
terrorism and extremism. I have only mentioned the most glaring but far from
only examples of disregard for international law.
This array includes promises not to expand NATO
eastwards even by an inch. To reiterate: they have deceived us, or, to put it
simply, they have played us. Sure, one often hears that politics is a dirty
business. It could be, but it shouldn’t be as dirty as it is now, not to such
an extent. This type of con-artist behaviour is contrary not only to the principles of international relations but also and above all to the generally accepted
norms of morality and ethics. Where is justice and truth here? Just lies and hypocrisy all around. 
Incidentally, US politicians, political
scientists and journalists write and say that a veritable “empire of lies” has
been created inside the United States in recent years. It is hard to disagree
with this – it is really so. But one
should not be modest about it: the United States is still a great country and a system-forming power. All its satellites not only humbly and obediently say yes
to and parrot it at the slightest pretext but also imitate its behaviour and enthusiastically accept the rules it is offering them. Therefore, one can say
with good reason and confidence that the whole so-called Western bloc formed by the United States in its own image and likeness is, in its entirety, the very
same “empire of lies.” 
As for our country, after the disintegration of the USSR, given the entire unprecedented openness of the new, modern Russia,
its readiness to work honestly with the United States and other Western
partners, and its practically unilateral disarmament, they immediately tried to put the final squeeze on us, finish us off, and utterly destroy us. This is how
it was in the 1990s and the early 2000s, when the so-called collective West was
actively supporting separatism and gangs of mercenaries in southern Russia.
What victims, what losses we had to sustain and what trials we had to go
through at that time before we broke the back of international terrorism in the Caucasus! We remember this and will never forget. 
Properly speaking, the attempts to use us in their own interests never ceased until quite recently: they sought to destroy
our traditional values and force on us their false values that would erode us,
our people from within, the attitudes they have been aggressively imposing on their countries, attitudes that are directly leading to degradation and degeneration, because they are contrary to human nature. This is not going to happen. No one has ever succeeded in doing this, nor will they succeed now. 
Despite all that, in December 2021, we made yet
another attempt to reach agreement with the United States and its allies on the principles of European security and NATO’s non-expansion. Our efforts were in vain. The United States has not changed its position. It does not believe it
necessary to agree with Russia on a matter that is critical for us. The United
States is pursuing its own objectives, while neglecting our interests.
Of course, this situation begs a question: what
next, what are we to expect? If history is any guide, we know that in 1940 and early 1941 the Soviet Union went to great lengths to prevent war or at least
delay its outbreak. To this end, the USSR sought not to provoke the potential aggressor
until the very end by refraining or postponing the most urgent and obvious
preparations it had to make to defend itself from an imminent attack. When it
finally acted, it was too late.
As a result, the country was not prepared to counter the invasion by Nazi Germany, which attacked our Motherland on June 22,
1941, without declaring war. The country stopped the enemy and went on to defeat it, but this came at a tremendous cost. The attempt to appease the aggressor
ahead of the Great Patriotic War proved to be a mistake which came at a high
cost for our people. In the first months after the hostilities broke out, we
lost vast territories of strategic importance, as well as millions of lives. We
will not make this mistake the second time. We have no right to do so.
Those who aspire to global dominance have
publicly designated Russia as their enemy. They did so with impunity. Make no mistake,
they had no reason to act this way. It is true that they have considerable financial,
scientific, technological, and military capabilities. We are aware of this and have an objective view of the economic threats we have been hearing, just as our ability to counter this brash and never-ending blackmail. Let me reiterate
that we have no illusions in this regard and are extremely realistic in our
assessments.
As for military affairs, even after the dissolution of the USSR and losing a considerable part of its capabilities,
today’s Russia remains one of the most powerful nuclear states. Moreover, it
has a certain advantage in several cutting-edge weapons. In this context, there
should be no doubt for anyone that any potential aggressor will face defeat and ominous consequences should it directly attack our country.
At the same time, technology, including in the defence sector, is changing rapidly. One day there is one leader, and tomorrow
another, but a military presence in territories bordering on Russia, if we
permit it to go ahead, will stay for decades to come or maybe forever, creating
an ever mounting and totally unacceptable threat for Russia.
Even now, with NATO’s eastward expansion the situation for Russia has been becoming worse and more dangerous by the year. Moreover,
these past days NATO leadership has been blunt in its statements that they need
to accelerate and step up efforts to bring the alliance’s infrastructure closer
to Russia’s borders. In other words, they have been toughening their position.
We cannot stay idle and passively observe these developments. This would be an absolutely irresponsible thing to do for us.
Any further expansion of the North Atlantic alliance’s
infrastructure or the ongoing efforts to gain a military foothold of the Ukrainian
territory are unacceptable for us. Of course, the question is not about NATO
itself. It merely serves as a tool of US foreign policy. The problem is that in territories adjacent to Russia, which I have to note is our historical land, a hostile “anti-Russia” is taking shape. Fully controlled from the outside, it is
doing everything to attract NATO armed forces and obtain cutting-edge weapons.
For the United States and its allies, it is a policy of containing Russia, with obvious geopolitical dividends. For our
country, it is a matter of life and death, a matter of our historical future as a nation. This is not an exaggeration; this is a fact. It is not only a very
real threat to our interests but to the very existence of our state and to its
sovereignty. It is the red line which we have spoken about on numerous
occasions. They have crossed it.
This brings me to the situation in Donbass. We
can see that the forces that staged the coup in Ukraine in 2014 have seized
power, are keeping it with the help of ornamental election procedures and have
abandoned the path of a peaceful conflict settlement. For eight years, for eight
endless years we have been doing everything possible to settle the situation by peaceful political means. Everything was in vain.
As I said in my previous address, you cannot
look without compassion at what is happening there. It became impossible to tolerate
it. We had to stop that atrocity, that genocide of the millions of people who
live there and who pinned their hopes on Russia, on all of us. It is their
aspirations, the feelings and pain of these people that were the main motivating
force behind our decision to recognise the independence of the Donbass people’s
republics.
I would like to additionally emphasise the following. Focused on their own goals, the leading NATO countries are
supporting the far-right nationalists and neo-Nazis in Ukraine, those who will
never forgive the people of Crimea and Sevastopol for freely making a choice to reunite with Russia.
They will undoubtedly try to bring war to Crimea just as they have done in Donbass, to kill innocent people just as members of the punitive units of Ukrainian nationalists and Hitler’s
accomplices did during the Great Patriotic War. They have also openly laid
claim to several other Russian regions.
If we look at the sequence of events and the incoming
reports, the showdown between Russia and these forces cannot be avoided. It is only
a matter of time. They are getting ready and waiting for the right moment. Moreover,
they went as far as aspire to acquire nuclear weapons. We will not let this happen.
I have already said that Russia accepted the new geopolitical reality after the dissolution of the USSR. We have been
treating all new post-Soviet states with respect and will continue to act this
way. We respect and will respect their sovereignty, as proven by the assistance
we provided to Kazakhstan when it faced tragic events and a challenge in terms
of its statehood and integrity. However, Russia cannot feel safe, develop, and exist while facing a permanent threat from the territory of today’s Ukraine.
Let me remind you that in 2000–2005 we used our
military to push back against terrorists in the Caucasus and stood up for the integrity of our state. We preserved Russia. In 2014, we supported the people
of Crimea and Sevastopol. In 2015, we used our Armed Forces to create a reliable shield that prevented terrorists from Syria from penetrating Russia. This
was a matter of defending ourselves. We had no other choice.
The same is happening today. They did not leave
us any other option for defending Russia and our people, other than the one we
are forced to use today. In these circumstances, we have to take bold and immediate action. The people’s republics of Donbass have asked Russia for help.
In this context, in accordance with Article 51 (Chapter
VII) of the UN Charter, with permission of Russia’s Federation Council, and in execution of the treaties of friendship and mutual assistance with the Donetsk People’s
Republic and the Lugansk People’s Republic, ratified by the Federal Assembly on February 22, I made a decision to carry out a special military operation.
The purpose of this operation is to protect people
who, for eight years now, have been facing humiliation and genocide perpetrated
by the Kiev regime. To this end, we will seek to demilitarise and denazify Ukraine,
as well as bring to trial those who perpetrated numerous bloody crimes against
civilians, including against citizens of the Russian Federation.
It is not our plan to occupy the Ukrainian
territory. We do not intend to impose anything on anyone by force. At the same
time, we have been hearing an increasing number of statements coming from the West
that there is no need any more to abide by the documents setting forth the outcomes of World War II, as signed by the totalitarian Soviet regime. How can
we respond to that?
The outcomes of World War II and the sacrifices
our people had to make to defeat Nazism are sacred. This does not contradict
the high values of human rights and freedoms in the reality that emerged over the post-war decades. This does not mean that nations cannot enjoy the right to self-determination, which is enshrined in Article 1 of the UN Charter.
Let me remind you that the people living in territories which are part of today’s Ukraine were not asked how they want to build their lives when the USSR was created or after World War II. Freedom
guides our policy, the freedom to choose independently our future and the future
of our children. We believe that all the peoples living in today’s Ukraine,
anyone who want to do this, must be able to enjoy this right to make a free
choice.
In this context I would like to address the citizens of Ukraine. In 2014, Russia was obliged to protect the people of Crimea and Sevastopol from those who you yourself call “nats.” The people of Crimea and Sevastopol made their choice in favour of being with their historical
homeland, Russia, and we supported their choice. As I said, we could not act
otherwise.
The current events have nothing to do with a desire to infringe on the interests of Ukraine and the Ukrainian people. They are
connected with the defending Russia from those who have taken Ukraine hostage
and are trying to use it against our country and our people.
I reiterate: we are acting to defend ourselves
from the threats created for us and from a worse peril than what is happening
now. I am asking you, however hard this may be, to understand this and to work
together with us so as to turn this tragic page as soon as possible and to move
forward together, without allowing anyone to interfere in our affairs and our
relations but developing them independently, so as to create favourable
conditions for overcoming all these problems and to strengthen us from within
as a single whole, despite the existence of state borders. I believe in this,
in our common future.
I would also like to address the military
personnel of the Ukrainian Armed Forces.
Comrade officers, 
Your fathers, grandfathers and great-grandfathers did not fight the Nazi occupiers and did not defend our
common Motherland to allow today’s neo-Nazis to seize power in Ukraine. You swore
the oath of allegiance to the Ukrainian people and not to the junta, the people’s adversary which is plundering Ukraine and humiliating the Ukrainian
people.
I urge you to refuse to carry out their
criminal orders. I urge you to immediately lay down arms and go home. I will
explain what this means: the military personnel of the Ukrainian army who do
this will be able to freely leave the zone of hostilities and return to their
families.
I want to emphasise again that all
responsibility for the possible bloodshed will lie fully and wholly with the ruling Ukrainian regime.
I would now like to say something
very important for those who may be tempted to interfere in these developments from
the outside. No matter who tries to stand in our way or all the more so create
threats for our country and our people, they must know that Russia will respond
immediately, and the consequences will be such as you have never seen in your
entire history. No matter how the events unfold, we are ready. All the necessary
decisions in this regard have been taken. I hope that my words will be heard.
Citizens of Russia,
The culture and values, experience
and traditions of our ancestors invariably provided a powerful underpinning for the wellbeing and the very existence of entire states and nations, their success
and viability. Of course, this directly depends on the ability to quickly adapt
to constant change, maintain social cohesion, and readiness to consolidate and summon
all the available forces in order to move forward.
We always need to be strong, but
this strength can take on different forms. The “empire of lies,” which I mentioned in the beginning of my speech, proceeds in its policy primarily from
rough, direct force. This is when our saying on being “all brawn and no brains”
applies.
We all know that having justice and truth on our side is what makes us truly strong. If this is the case, it would
be hard to disagree with the fact that it is our strength and our readiness to fight that are the bedrock of independence and sovereignty and provide the necessary foundation for building a reliable future for your home, your family,
and your Motherland.
Dear compatriots, 
I am certain that devoted soldiers
and officers of Russia’s Armed Forces will perform their duty with
professionalism and courage. I have no doubt that the government institutions at all levels and specialists will work effectively to guarantee the stability of our economy, financial system and social wellbeing, and the same applies to corporate
executives and the entire business community. I hope that all parliamentary
parties and civil society take a consolidated, patriotic position.
At the end of the day, the future of Russia is in the hands of its multi-ethnic people, as has always been the case
in our history. This means that the decisions that I made will be executed,
that we will achieve the goals we have set, and reliably guarantee the security
of our Motherland.
 I believe in your support and the invincible force rooted
in the love for our Fatherland.
"
2022-02-21,"Citizens of Russia, friends,
My address
concerns the events in Ukraine and why this is so important for us, for Russia.
Of course, my message is also addressed to our compatriots in Ukraine.
The matter is
very serious and needs to be discussed in depth.
The situation
in Donbass has reached a critical, acute stage. I am speaking to you directly
today not only to explain what is happening but also to inform you of the decisions being made as well as potential further steps.
I would like
to emphasise again that Ukraine is not just a neighbouring country for us. It
is an inalienable part of our own history, culture and spiritual space. These are
our comrades, those dearest to us – not only colleagues, friends and people who
once served together, but also relatives, people bound by blood, by family
ties.
Since time
immemorial, the people living in the south-west of what has historically been Russian
land have called themselves Russians and Orthodox Christians. This was the case
before the 17th century, when a portion of this territory rejoined
the Russian state, and after.
It seems to us that, generally speaking, we all know these facts, that this is common
knowledge. Still, it is necessary to say at least a few words about the history
of this issue in order to understand what is happening today, to explain the motives behind Russia’s actions and what we aim to achieve.
So, I will start with the fact that modern
Ukraine was entirely created by Russia or, to be more precise, by Bolshevik, Communist
Russia. This process started practically right after the 1917 revolution, and Lenin
and his associates did it in a way that was extremely harsh on Russia – by separating, severing what is historically Russian land. Nobody asked the millions
of people living there what they thought.
Then, both before and after the Great
Patriotic War, Stalin incorporated in the USSR and transferred to Ukraine some
lands that previously belonged to Poland, Romania and Hungary. In the process, he
gave Poland part of what was traditionally German land as compensation, and in 1954,
Khrushchev took Crimea away from Russia for some reason and also gave it to Ukraine. In effect, this is how the territory of modern Ukraine was formed. 
But now I would like to focus attention
on the initial period of the USSR’s formation. I believe this is extremely important
for us. I will have to approach it from a distance, so to speak. 
I will remind you that after the 1917 October Revolution and the subsequent Civil War, the Bolsheviks set about creating
a new statehood. They had rather serious disagreements among themselves on this
point. In 1922, Stalin occupied the positions of both the General Secretary of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) and the People’s Commissar for Ethnic Affairs.
He suggested building the country on the principles of autonomisation that is,
giving the republics – the future administrative and territorial entities – broad
powers upon joining a unified state.
Lenin criticised this plan and suggested
making concessions to the nationalists, whom he called “independents” at that time.
Lenin’s ideas of what amounted in essence to a confederative state arrangement
and a slogan about the right of nations to self-determination, up to secession,
were laid in the foundation of Soviet statehood. Initially they were confirmed
in the Declaration on the Formation of the USSR in 1922, and later on, after
Lenin’s death, were enshrined in the 1924 Soviet Constitution.
This immediately raises many
questions. The first is really the main one: why was it necessary to appease
the nationalists, to satisfy the ceaselessly growing nationalist ambitions on the outskirts of the former empire? What was the point of transferring to the newly, often arbitrarily formed administrative units – the union republics – vast
territories that had nothing to do with them? Let me repeat that these
territories were transferred along with the population of what was historically
Russia.
Moreover, these administrative units
were de facto given the status and form of national state entities. That raises
another question: why was it necessary to make such generous gifts, beyond the wildest dreams of the most zealous nationalists and, on top of all that, give
the republics the right to secede from the unified state without any conditions?

At first glance, this looks absolutely incomprehensible, even crazy. But
only at first glance. There is an explanation. After the revolution, the Bolsheviks’ main goal was to stay in power at all costs, absolutely at all
costs. They did everything for this purpose: accepted the humiliating Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, although the military and economic situation in Kaiser Germany
and its allies was dramatic and the outcome of the First World War was a foregone
conclusion, and satisfied any demands and wishes of the nationalists within the country.
When it comes to the historical destiny of Russia and its peoples,
Lenin’s principles of state development were not just a mistake; they were
worse than a mistake, as the saying goes. This became patently clear after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991.
Of course, we cannot change past events, but we must at least admit them
openly and honestly, without any reservations or politicking. Personally, I can
add that no political factors, however impressive or profitable they may seem
at any given moment, can or may be used as the fundamental principles of statehood.
I am not trying to put the blame on anyone. The situation in the country
at that time, both before and after the Civil War, was extremely complicated;
it was critical. The only thing I would like to say today is that this is
exactly how it was. It is a historical fact. Actually, as I have already said,
Soviet Ukraine is the result of the Bolsheviks’ policy and can be rightfully
called “Vladimir Lenin’s Ukraine.” He was its creator and architect. This is
fully and comprehensively corroborated by archival documents, including Lenin’s
harsh instructions regarding Donbass, which was actually shoved into Ukraine.
And today the “grateful progeny” has overturned monuments to Lenin in Ukraine. They
call it decommunization.
You want decommunization? Very well, this suits us just fine. But why
stop halfway? We are ready to show what real decommunizations would mean for Ukraine.
Going back to history, I would like to repeat that the Soviet Union was
established in the place of the former Russian Empire in 1922. But practice
showed immediately that it was impossible to preserve or govern such a vast and complex territory on the amorphous principles that amounted to confederation.
They were far removed from reality and the historical tradition.
It is logical that the Red Terror and a rapid slide into Stalin’s
dictatorship, the domination of the communist ideology and the Communist
Party’s monopoly on power, nationalisation and the planned economy – all this transformed
the formally declared but ineffective principles of government into a mere
declaration. In reality, the union republics did not have any sovereign rights,
none at all. The practical result was the creation of a tightly centralised and absolutely unitary state.
In fact, what Stalin fully implemented was not Lenin’s but his own
principles of government. But he did not make the relevant amendments to the cornerstone documents, to the Constitution, and he did not formally revise
Lenin’s principles underlying the Soviet Union. From the look of it, there
seemed to be no need for that, because everything seemed to be working well in conditions of the totalitarian regime, and outwardly it looked wonderful,
attractive and even super-democratic.
And yet, it is a great pity that the fundamental and formally legal
foundations of our state were not promptly cleansed of the odious and utopian
fantasies inspired by the revolution, which are absolutely destructive for any
normal state. As it often happened in our country before, nobody gave any
thought to the future.
It seems that the Communist Party leaders were convinced that they had
created a solid system of government and that their policies had settled the ethnic
issue for good. But falsification, misconception, and tampering with public
opinion have a high cost. The virus of nationalist ambitions is still with us,
and the mine laid at the initial stage to destroy state immunity to the disease
of nationalism was ticking. As I have already said, the mine was the right of secession from the Soviet Union.
In the mid-1980s, the increasing socioeconomic problems and the apparent
crisis of the planned economy aggravated the ethnic issue, which essentially was
not based on any expectations or unfulfilled dreams of the Soviet peoples but
primarily the growing appetites of the local elites.
However, instead of analysing the situation, taking appropriate
measures, first of all in the economy, and gradually transforming the political
system and government in a well-considered and balanced manner, the Communist
Party leadership only engaged in open doubletalk about the revival of the Leninist principle of national self-determination.
Moreover, in the course of power struggle within the Communist Party
itself, each of the opposing sides, in a bid to expand its support base,
started to thoughtlessly incite and encourage nationalist sentiments, manipulating
them and promising their potential supporters whatever they wished. Against the backdrop of the superficial and populist rhetoric about democracy and a bright
future based either on a market or a planned economy, but amid a true
impoverishment of people and widespread shortages, no one among the powers that
be was thinking about the inevitable tragic consequences for the country.
Next, they entirely embarked on the track beaten at the inception of the USSR and pandering to the ambitions of the nationalist elites nurtured within
their own party ranks. But in so doing, they forgot that the CPSU no longer had – thank God – the tools for retaining power and the country itself, tools such
as state terror and a Stalinist-type dictatorship, and that the notorious
guiding role of the party was disappearing without a trace, like a morning
mist, right before their eyes. 
And then, the September 1989 plenary session of the CPSU Central
Committee approved a truly fatal document, the so-called ethnic policy of the party in modern conditions, the CPSU platform. It included the following
provisions, I quote: “The republics of the USSR shall possess all the rights
appropriate to their status as sovereign socialist states.”
The next point: “The supreme representative bodies of power of the USSR
republics can challenge and suspend the operation of the USSR Government’s
resolutions and directives in their territory.”
And finally: “Each republic of the USSR shall have citizenship of its
own, which shall apply to all of its residents.” 
Wasn’t it clear what these formulas and decisions would lead to?
Now is not the time or place to go into matters pertaining to state or constitutional law, or define the concept of citizenship. But one may wonder: why
was it necessary to rock the country even more in that already complicated situation?
The facts remain. 
Even two years before the collapse of the USSR, its fate was actually
predetermined. It is now that radicals and nationalists, including and primarily those in Ukraine, are taking credit for having gained independence.
As we can see, this is absolutely wrong. The disintegration of our united
country was brought about by the historic, strategic mistakes on the part of the Bolshevik leaders and the CPSU leadership, mistakes committed at different
times in state-building and in economic and ethnic policies. The collapse of the historical Russia known as the USSR is on their conscience.
Despite all these injustices, lies and outright
pillage of Russia, it was our people who accepted the new geopolitical reality
that took shape after the dissolution of the USSR, and recognised the new
independent states. Not only did Russia recognise these countries, but helped
its CIS partners, even though it faced a very dire situation itself. This
included our Ukrainian colleagues, who turned to us for financial support many
times from the very moment they declared independence. Our country provided
this assistance while respecting Ukraine’s dignity and sovereignty.
According to expert assessments, confirmed by a simple calculation of our energy prices, the subsidised loans Russia provided to Ukraine along with economic and trade preferences, the overall benefit for the Ukrainian budget in the period from 1991 to 2013 amounted to $250 billion.
However, there was more to it than that. By the end of 1991, the USSR owed some $100 billion to other countries and international funds. Initially, there was this idea that all former Soviet
republics will pay back these loans together, in the spirit of solidarity and proportionally to their economic potential. However, Russia undertook to pay
back all Soviet debts and delivered on this promise by completing this process
in 2017.
In exchange for that, the newly independent
states had to hand over to Russia part of the Soviet foreign assets. An agreement to this effect was reached with Ukraine in December 1994. However,
Kiev failed to ratify these agreements and later simply refused to honour them
by making demands for a share of the Diamond Treasury, gold reserves, as well
as former USSR property and other assets abroad.
Nevertheless, despite all these challenges, Russia
always worked with Ukraine in an open and honest manner and, as I have already
said, with respect for its interests. We developed our ties in multiple fields.
Thus, in 2011, bilateral trade exceeded $50 billion. Let me note that in 2019, that
is before the pandemic, Ukraine’s trade with all EU countries combined was
below this indicator.
At the same time, it was striking how the Ukrainian authorities always preferred dealing with Russia in a way that
ensured that they enjoy all the rights and privileges while remaining free from
any obligations.
The officials in Kiev replaced partnership with
a parasitic attitude acting at times in an extremely brash manner. Suffice it to recall the continuous blackmail on energy transits and the fact that they literally
stole gas.
I can add that Kiev tried to use dialogue with
Russia as a bargaining chip in its relations with the West, using the threat of closer ties with Russia for blackmailing the West to secure preferences by claiming
that otherwise Russia would have a bigger influence in Ukraine.
At the same time, the Ukrainian authorities – I would like to emphasise
this – began by building their statehood on the negation of everything
that united us, trying to distort the mentality and historical memory of millions of people, of entire generations living in Ukraine. It is not
surprising that Ukrainian society was faced with the rise of far-right
nationalism, which rapidly developed into aggressive Russophobia and neo-Nazism. This resulted in the participation of Ukrainian nationalists and neo-Nazis in the terrorist groups in the North Caucasus and the increasingly loud
territorial claims to Russia.
A role in this was played by external forces, which used a ramified
network of NGOs and special services to nurture their clients in Ukraine and to bring their representatives to the seats of authority.
It should be noted that Ukraine actually never had stable traditions of real statehood. And, therefore, in 1991 it opted for mindlessly emulating
foreign models, which have no relation to history or Ukrainian realities. Political
government institutions were readjusted many times to the rapidly growing clans
and their self-serving interests, which had nothing to do with the interests of the Ukrainian people.
Essentially, the so-called pro-Western civilisational choice made by the oligarchic Ukrainian authorities was not and is not aimed at creating better
conditions in the interests of people’s well-being but at keeping the billions
of dollars that the oligarchs have stolen from the Ukrainians and are holding
in their accounts in Western banks, while reverently accommodating the geopolitical rivals of Russia. 
Some industrial and financial groups and the parties and politicians on their payroll relied on the nationalists and radicals from the very beginning.
Others claimed to be in favour of good relations with Russia and cultural and language diversity, coming to power with the help of their citizens who
sincerely supported their declared aspirations, including the millions of people in the south-eastern regions. But after getting the positions they
coveted, these people immediately betrayed their voters, going back on their
election promises and instead steering a policy prompted by the radicals and sometimes even persecuting their former allies – the public organisations that
supported bilingualism and cooperation with Russia. These people took advantage
of the fact that their voters were mostly law-abiding citizens with moderate
views who trusted the authorities, and that, unlike the radicals, they would
not act aggressively or make use of illegal instruments.
Meanwhile, the radicals became increasingly brazen in their actions and made more demands every year. They found it easy to force their will on the weak
authorities, which were infected with the virus of nationalism and corruption
as well and which artfully replaced the real cultural, economic and social
interests of the people and Ukraine’s true sovereignty with various ethnic
speculations and formal ethnic attributes.
A stable statehood has never developed
in Ukraine; its electoral and other political procedures just serve as a cover,
a screen for the redistribution of power and property between various
oligarchic clans.
Corruption, which is certainly a challenge and a problem for many countries, including Russia, has gone beyond
the usual scope in Ukraine. It has literally permeated and corroded Ukrainian
statehood, the entire system, and all branches of power.
Radical nationalists took advantage
of the justified public discontent and saddled the Maidan protest, escalating
it to a coup d'état in 2014. They also had direct assistance from foreign
states. According to reports, the US Embassy provided $1 million a day to support
the so-called protest camp on Independence Square in Kiev. In addition, large
amounts were impudently transferred directly to the opposition leaders’ bank
accounts, tens of millions of dollars. But the people who actually suffered,
the families of those who died in the clashes provoked in the streets and squares of Kiev and other cities, how much did they get in the end? Better not ask.
The nationalists who have seized
power have unleashed a persecution, a real terror campaign against those who
opposed their anti-constitutional actions. Politicians, journalists, and public
activists were harassed and publicly humiliated. A wave of violence swept Ukrainian
cities, including a series of high-profile and unpunished murders. One shudders
at the memories of the terrible tragedy in Odessa, where peaceful protesters
were brutally murdered, burned alive in the House of Trade Unions. The criminals who committed that atrocity have never been punished, and no one is even
looking for them. But we know their names and we will do everything to punish them,
find them and bring them to justice.
Maidan did not bring Ukraine any closer
to democracy and progress. Having accomplished a coup d'état, the nationalists
and those political forces that supported them eventually led Ukraine into an impasse, pushed the country into the abyss of civil war. Eight years later, the country is split. Ukraine is struggling with an acute socioeconomic crisis.
According to international organisations,
in 2019, almost 6 million Ukrainians – I emphasise – about 15 percent, not of the wokrforce, but of the entire population of that country, had to go abroad to find work. Most of them do odd jobs. The following fact is also revealing:
since 2020, over 60,000 doctors and other health workers have left the country amid
the pandemic.
Since 2014, water bills increased by almost a third, and energy bills grew several times, while the price of gas
for households surged several dozen times. Many people simply do not have the money to pay for utilities. They literally struggle to survive.
What happened? Why is this all happening? The answer is obvious. They spent and embezzled the legacy inherited not only from the Soviet era, but also from the Russian Empire. They lost tens, hundreds of thousands of jobs which enabled people to earn a reliable income and generate
tax revenue, among other things thanks to close cooperation with Russia. Sectors
including machine building, instrument engineering, electronics, ship and aircraft building have been undermined or destroyed altogether. There was a time, however, when not only Ukraine, but the entire Soviet Union took pride in these companies.
In 2021, the Black Sea Shipyard in Nikolayev
went out of business. Its first docks date back to Catherine the Great. Antonov,
the famous manufacturer, has not made a single commercial aircraft since 2016,
while Yuzhmash, a factory specialising in missile and space equipment,
is nearly bankrupt. The Kremenchug Steel Plant is in a similar situation. This
sad list goes on and on.
As for the gas transportation system, it was
built in its entirety by the Soviet Union, and it has now deteriorated to an extent that using it creates major risks and comes at a high cost for the environment.
This situation begs the question: poverty, lack
of opportunity, and lost industrial and technological potential – is this the pro-Western civilisational choice they have been using for many years to fool millions
of people with promises of heavenly pastures?
It all came down to a Ukrainian economy in tatters and an outright pillage of the country’s citizens, while Ukraine itself
was placed under external control, directed not only from the Western capitals,
but also on the ground, as the saying goes, through an entire network of foreign advisors, NGOs and other institutions present in Ukraine. They have a direct bearing on all the key appointments and dismissals and on all branches
of power at all levels, from the central government down to municipalities, as well as on state-owned companies and corporations, including Naftogaz, Ukrenergo,
Ukrainian Railways, Ukroboronprom, Ukrposhta, and the Ukrainian Sea Ports
Authority.
There is no independent judiciary in Ukraine. The Kiev authorities, at the West’s demand, delegated the priority right to select
members of the supreme judicial bodies, the Council of Justice and the High
Qualifications Commission of Judges, to international organisations.
In addition, the United States directly controls
the National Agency on Corruption Prevention, the National Anti-Corruption
Bureau, the Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office and the High
Anti-Corruption Court. All this is done under the noble pretext of invigorating
efforts against corruption. All right, but where are the results? Corruption is
flourishing like never before.
Are the Ukrainian people aware that this is how
their country is managed? Do they realise that their country has turned not
even into a political or economic protectorate but has been reduced to a colony
with a puppet regime? The state was privatised. As a result, the government, which
designates itself as the “power of patriots” no longer acts in a national
capacity and consistently pushes Ukraine towards losing its sovereignty.
The policy to root out the Russian language and culture and promote assimilation carries on. The Verkhovna Rada has generated a steady flow of discriminatory bills, and the law on the so-called indigenous people
has already come into force. People who identify as Russians and want to preserve their identity, language and culture are getting the signal that they
are not wanted in Ukraine.
Under the laws on education and the Ukrainian language
as a state language, the Russian language has no place in schools or public
spaces, even in ordinary shops. The law on the so-called vetting of officials
and purging their ranks created a pathway for dealing with unwanted civil servants.
There are more and more acts enabling the Ukrainian military and law enforcement agencies to crack down on the freedom of speech, dissent, and going after the opposition. The world knows the deplorable
practice of imposing unilateral illegitimate sanctions against other countries,
foreign individuals and legal entities. Ukraine has outperformed its Western
masters by inventing sanctions against its own citizens, companies, television
channels, other media outlets and even members of parliament.
Kiev continues to prepare the destruction of the Ukrainian Orthodox
Church of the Moscow Patriarchate. This is not an emotional judgement; proof of this can be found in concrete decisions and documents. The Ukrainian
authorities have cynically turned the tragedy of the schism into an instrument
of state policy. The current authorities do not react to the Ukrainian people’s
appeals to abolish the laws that are infringing on believers’ rights. Moreover,
new draft laws directed against the clergy and millions of parishioners of the Ukrainian
Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate have been registered in the Verkhovna Rada.
A few words about Crimea. The people of the peninsula freely made their
choice to be with Russia. The Kiev authorities cannot challenge the clearly stated
choice of the people, which is why they have opted for aggressive action, for activating extremist cells, including radical Islamist organisations, for sending subversives to stage terrorist attacks at critical infrastructure
facilities, and for kidnapping Russian citizens. We have factual proof that
such aggressive actions are being taken with support from Western security
services.
In March 2021, a new Military Strategy was adopted in Ukraine. This
document is almost entirely dedicated to confrontation with Russia and sets the goal of involving foreign states in a conflict with our country. The strategy
stipulates the organisation of what can be described as a terrorist underground
movement in Russia’s Crimea and in Donbass. It also sets out the contours of a potential war, which should end, according to the Kiev strategists, “with the assistance of the international community on favourable terms for Ukraine,” as well as – listen carefully, please – “with foreign military support in the geopolitical confrontation with the Russian Federation.” In fact, this is
nothing other than preparation for hostilities against our country, Russia. 
As we know, it has already been stated today that Ukraine intends to create its own nuclear weapons, and this is not just bragging. Ukraine has the nuclear technologies created back in the Soviet times and delivery vehicles for such weapons, including aircraft, as well as the Soviet-designed Tochka-U precision
tactical missiles with a range of over 100 kilometres. But they can do more; it
is only a matter of time. They have had the groundwork for this since the Soviet era.
In other words, acquiring tactical nuclear weapons will be much easier
for Ukraine than for some other states I am not going to mention here, which
are conducting such research, especially if Kiev receives foreign technological support. We cannot rule
this out either.
If Ukraine acquires weapons of mass destruction,
the situation in the world and in Europe will drastically change, especially for us, for Russia. We cannot but react to this real danger, all the more so since,
let me repeat, Ukraine’s Western patrons may help it acquire these weapons to create yet another threat to our country. We are seeing how persistently the Kiev regime is being pumped with arms. Since 2014, the United States alone has
spent billions of dollars for this purpose, including supplies of arms and equipment and training of specialists. In the last few months, there has been a constant flow of Western weapons to Ukraine, ostentatiously, with the entire
world watching. Foreign advisors supervise the activities of Ukraine’s armed
forces and special services and we are well aware of this. 
Over the past few years, military contingents
of NATO countries have been almost constantly present on Ukrainian territory under
the pretext of exercises. The Ukrainian troop control system has already been
integrated into NATO. This means that NATO headquarters can issue direct commands
to the Ukrainian armed forces, even to their separate units and squads. 
The United States and NATO have
started an impudent development of Ukrainian territory as a theatre of potential military operations. Their regular joint exercises are obviously
anti-Russian. Last year alone, over 23,000 troops and more than a thousand
units of hardware were involved.
A law has already been adopted that allows
foreign troops to come to Ukraine in 2022 to take part in multinational drills.
Understandably, these are primarily NATO troops. This year, at least ten of these
joint drills are planned. 
Obviously, such undertakings are designed
to be a cover-up for a rapid buildup of the NATO military group on Ukrainian
territory. This is all the more so since the network of airfields upgraded with
US help in Borispol, Ivano-Frankovsk, Chuguyev and Odessa, to name a few, is
capable of transferring army units in a very short time. Ukraine’s airspace is open
to flights by US strategic and reconnaissance aircraft and drones that conduct
surveillance over Russian territory.
I will add that the US-built Maritime
Operations Centre in Ochakov makes it possible to support activity by NATO warships,
including the use of precision weapons, against the Russian Black Sea Fleet and our infrastructure on the entire Black Sea Coast.
At one time, the United States
intended to build similar facilities in Crimea as well but the Crimeans and residents of Sevastopol wrecked these plans. We will always remember this.
I would like to repeat that today
such a centre has already been deployed in Ochakov. In the 18th century,
soldiers of Alexander Suvorov fought for this city. Owing to their courage, it
became part of Russia. Also in the 18th century, the lands of the Black Sea littoral, incorporated in Russia as a result of wars with the Ottoman
Empire, were given the name of Novorossiya (New Russia). Now attempts are being
made to condemn these landmarks of history to oblivion, along with the names of state and military figures of the Russian Empire without whose efforts modern
Ukraine would not have many big cities or even access to the Black Sea.
A monument to Alexander Suvorov was
recently demolished in Poltava. What is there to say? Are you renouncing your own
past? The so-called colonial heritage of the Russian Empire? Well, in this case,
be consistent.
Next, notably, Article 17 of the Constitution of Ukraine stipulates that
deploying foreign military bases on its territory is illegal. However, as it
turns out, this is just a conventionality that can be easily circumvented.
Ukraine is home to NATO training missions which are, in fact, foreign
military bases. They just called a base a mission and were done with it.
Kiev has long proclaimed a strategic course on joining NATO. Indeed,
each country is entitled to pick its own security system and enter into
military alliances. There would be no problem with that, if it were not for one
“but.” International documents expressly stipulate the principle of equal and indivisible security, which includes obligations not to strengthen one's own security
at the expense of the security of other states. This is stated in the 1999 OSCE
Charter for European Security adopted in Istanbul and the 2010 OSCE Astana
Declaration.
In other words, the choice of pathways towards ensuring security should
not pose a threat to other states, whereas Ukraine joining NATO is a direct
threat to Russia's security.
Let me remind you that at the Bucharest NATO summit held in April 2008,
the United States pushed through a decision to the effect that Ukraine and, by the way, Georgia would become NATO members. Many European allies of the United
States were well aware of the risks associated with this prospect already then,
but were forced to put up with the will of their senior partner. The Americans
simply used them to carry out a clearly anti-Russian policy.
A number of NATO member states are still very sceptical about Ukraine joining
NATO. We are getting signals from some European capitals telling us not to worry since it will not happen literally overnight. In fact, our US partners
are saying the same thing as well. “All right, then” we respond, “if it does not
happen tomorrow, then it will happen the day after tomorrow. What does it
change from the historical perspective? Nothing at all.”
Furthermore, we are aware of the US leadership’s position and words that
active hostilities in eastern Ukraine do not rule out the possibility of that country
joining NATO if it meets NATO criteria and overcomes corruption.
All the while, they are trying to convince us over and over again that
NATO is a peace-loving and purely defensive alliance that poses no threat to Russia. Again, they want us to take their word for it. But we are well aware of the real value of these words. In 1990, when German unification was discussed,
the United States promised the Soviet leadership that NATO jurisdiction or military
presence will not expand one inch to the east and that the unification of Germany will not lead to the spread of NATO's military organisation to the east. This is a quote.
They issued lots of verbal assurances, all of which turned out to be
empty phrases. Later, they began to assure us that the accession to NATO by Central and Eastern European countries would only improve relations with
Moscow, relieve these countries of the fears steeped in their bitter historical
legacy, and even create a belt of countries that are friendly towards Russia.
However, the exact opposite happened.
The governments of certain Eastern European countries, speculating on Russophobia,
brought their complexes and stereotypes about the Russian threat to the Alliance and insisted on building up the collective defence potentials and deploying
them primarily against Russia. Worse still, that happened in the 1990s and the early
2000s when, thanks to our openness and goodwill, relations between Russia and the West had reached a high level.
Russia has fulfilled all of its
obligations, including the pullout from Germany, from Central and Eastern
Europe, making an immense contribution to overcoming the legacy of the Cold
War. We have consistently proposed various cooperation options, including in the NATO-Russia Council and the OSCE formats.
Moreover, I will say something I have never said publicly, I will say it now for the first time. When then outgoing
US President Bill Clinton visited Moscow in 2000, I asked him how America would
feel about admitting Russia to NATO.
I will not reveal all the details of that conversation, but the reaction to my question was, let us say, quite restrained,
and the Americans’ true attitude to that possibility can actually be seen from their
subsequent steps with regard to our country. I am referring to the overt support
for terrorists in the North Caucasus, the disregard for our security demands
and concerns, NATO’s continued expansion, withdrawal from the ABM Treaty, and so on. It raises the question: why? What is all this about, what is the purpose?
All right, you do not want to see us as friends or allies, but why make us an enemy?
There can be only one answer – this is
not about our political regime or anything like that. They just do not need a big and independent country like Russia around. This is the answer to all
questions. This is the source of America’s traditional policy towards Russia.
Hence the attitude to all our security proposals
Today, one glance at the map is
enough to see to what extent Western countries have kept their promise to refrain
from NATO’s eastward expansion. They just cheated. We have seen five waves of NATO expansion, one after another – Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary were
admitted in 1999; Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia in 2004; Albania and Croatia in 2009; Montenegro in 2017; and North
Macedonia in 2020.
As a result, the Alliance, its
military infrastructure has reached Russia’s borders. This is one of the key
causes of the European security crisis; it has had the most negative impact on the entire system of international relations and led to the loss of mutual
trust.
The situation continues to deteriorate,
including in the strategic area. Thus, positioning areas for interceptor
missiles are being established in Romania and Poland as part of the US project to create a global missile defence system. It is common knowledge that the launchers deployed there can be used for Tomahawk cruise missiles – offensive strike
systems. 
In addition, the United States is developing
its all-purpose Standard Missile-6, which can provide air and missile defence, as well as strike ground and surface targets. In other words, the allegedly defensive
US missile defence system is developing and expanding its new offensive
capabilities. 
The information we have gives us good
reason to believe that Ukraine’s accession to NATO and the subsequent deployment
of NATO facilities has already been decided and is only a matter of time. We clearly
understand that given this scenario, the level of military threats to Russia
will increase dramatically, several times over. And I would like to emphasise at this point that the risk of a sudden strike at our country will multiply. 
I will explain that American strategic
planning documents confirm the possibility of a so-called preemptive strike at enemy
missile systems. We also know the main adversary of the United States and NATO.
It is Russia. NATO documents
officially declare our country to be the main threat to Euro-Atlantic security.
Ukraine will serve as an advanced bridgehead for such a strike. If our ancestors
heard about this, they would probably simply not believe this. We do not want
to believe this today either, but it is what it is. I would like people in Russia
and Ukraine to understand this.
Many Ukrainian airfields are located
not far from our borders. NATO’s tactical aviation deployed there, including
precision weapon carriers, will be capable of striking at our territory to the depth of the Volgograd-Kazan-Samara-Astrakhan line. The deployment of reconnaissance
radars on Ukrainian territory will allow NATO to tightly control Russia’s airspace
up to the Urals. 
Finally, after the US destroyed the INF Treaty, the Pentagon has been openly developing many land-based attack
weapons, including ballistic missiles that are capable of hitting targets at a distance of up to 5,500 km. If deployed in Ukraine, such systems will be able
to hit targets in Russia’s entire European part. The flying time of Tomahawk
cruise missiles to Moscow will be less than 35 minutes; ballistic missiles from
Kharkov will take seven to eight minutes; and hypersonic assault weapons, four
to five minutes. It is like a knife to the throat. I have no doubt that they
hope to carry out these plans, as they did many times in the past, expanding
NATO eastward, moving their military infrastructure to Russian borders and fully ignoring our concerns, protests and warnings. Excuse me, but they simply
did not care at all about such things and did whatever they deemed necessary. 
Of course, they are going to behave
in the same way in the future, following a well-known proverb: “The dogs bark
but the caravan goes on.” Let me say right away – we do not accept this behaviour
and will never accept it. That said, Russia has always advocated the resolution
of the most complicated problems by political and diplomatic means, at the negotiating table.
We are well aware of our enormous
responsibility when it comes to regional and global stability. Back in 2008,
Russia put forth an initiative to conclude a European Security Treaty under
which not a single Euro-Atlantic state or international organisation could
strengthen their security at the expense of the security of others. However,
our proposal was rejected right off the bat on the pretext that Russia should
not be allowed to put limits on NATO activities.
Furthermore, it was made explicitly clear
to us that only NATO members can have legally binding security guarantees.
Last December, we handed over to our
Western partners a draft treaty between the Russian Federation and the United
States of America on security guarantees, as well as a draft agreement on measures to ensure the security of the Russian Federation and NATO member
states.
The United States and NATO responded
with general statements. There were kernels of rationality in them as well, but
they concerned matters of secondary importance and it all looked like an attempt to drag the issue out and to lead the discussion astray.
We responded to this accordingly and pointed out that we were ready to follow the path of negotiations, provided,
however, that all issues are considered as a package that includes Russia’s
core proposals which contain three key points. First, to prevent further NATO
expansion. Second, to have the Alliance refrain from deploying assault weapon
systems on Russian borders. And finally, rolling back the bloc's military capability
and infrastructure in Europe to where they were in 1997, when the NATO-Russia
Founding Act was signed.
These principled proposals of ours
have been ignored. To reiterate, our Western partners have once again vocalised
the all-too-familiar formulas that each state is entitled to freely choose ways
to ensure its security or to join any military union or alliance. That is,
nothing has changed in their stance, and we keep hearing the same old references
to NATO’s notorious “open door” policy. Moreover, they are again trying to blackmail us and are threatening us with sanctions, which, by the way, they
will introduce no matter what as Russia continues to strengthen its sovereignty
and its Armed Forces. To be sure, they will never think twice before coming up
with or just fabricating a pretext for yet another sanction attack regardless
of the developments in Ukraine. Their one and only goal is to hold back the development of Russia. And they will keep doing so, just as they did before,
even without any formal pretext just because we exist and will never compromise
our sovereignty, national interests or values.
I would like to be clear and straightforward:
in the current circumstances, when our proposals for an equal dialogue on fundamental issues have actually remained unanswered by the United States and NATO, when the level of threats to our country has increased significantly,
Russia has every right to respond in order to ensure its security. That is
exactly what we will do.
With regard to the state of affairs
in Donbass, we see that the ruling Kiev elites never stop publicly making clear
their unwillingness to comply with the Minsk Package of Measures to settle the conflict and are not interested in a peaceful settlement. On the contrary, they
are trying to orchestrate a blitzkrieg in Donbass as was the case in 2014 and 2015. We all know how these reckless schemes ended.
Not a single day goes by without
Donbass communities coming under shelling attacks. The recently formed large
military force makes use of attack drones, heavy equipment, missiles, artillery
and multiple rocket launchers. The killing of civilians, the blockade, the abuse of people, including children, women and the elderly, continues unabated.
As we say, there is no end in sight to this.
Meanwhile, the so-called civilised
world, which our Western colleagues proclaimed themselves the only
representatives of, prefers not to see this, as if this horror and genocide,
which almost 4 million people are facing, do not exist. But they do exist and only because these people did not agree with the West-supported coup in Ukraine
in 2014 and opposed the transition towards the Neanderthal and aggressive
nationalism and neo-Nazism which have been elevated in Ukraine to the rank of national
policy. They are fighting for their elementary right to live on their own land,
to speak their own language, and to preserve their culture and traditions.
How long can this tragedy continue?
How much longer can one put up with this? Russia has done everything to preserve Ukraine’s territorial integrity. All these years, it has persistently
and patiently pushed for the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution
2202 of February 17, 2015, which consolidated the Minsk Package of Measures of February 12, 2015, to settle the situation in Donbass.
Everything was in vain. Presidents
and Rada deputies come and go, but deep down the aggressive and nationalistic
regime that seized power in Kiev remains unchanged. It is entirely a product of the 2014 coup, and those who then embarked on the path of violence, bloodshed
and lawlessness did not recognise then and do not recognise now any solution to the Donbass issue other than a military one.
In this regard, I consider it necessary
to take a long overdue decision and to immediately recognise the independence
and sovereignty of the Donetsk People's Republic and the Lugansk People's
Republic.
I would like to ask the Federal
Assembly of the Russian Federation to support this decision and then ratify the Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Assistance with both republics. These two
documents will be prepared and signed shortly.
We want those who seized and continue
to hold power in Kiev to immediately stop hostilities. Otherwise, the responsibility for the possible continuation of the bloodshed will lie entirely
on the conscience of Ukraine’s ruling regime.
As I announce the decisions taken
today, I remain confident in the support of Russia’s citizens and the country’s
patriotic forces.
 Thank you.
"
2022-02-21,"Good afternoon, colleagues.
We are meeting
today to discuss the current developments in Donbass. 
I will briefly
remind you how it all started and how the situation has developed even though you
know this very well. But we need general background to help us make appropriate
decisions. 
So, after the 2014 coup in Ukraine, part of the population did not accept the outcome. Let me
remind you that this was an anti-constitutional, blood-shedding coup that killed
many innocent people. It was truly an armed coup. Nobody can argue that. 
Some of the country’s citizens did not accept the coup. They were residents of Crimea and the people who currently live in Donbass. 
Those people
declared that they were establishing two independent republics, the Donetsk People’s
Republic and the Lugansk People’s Republic. This was the point when the confrontation
started between the Kiev officials and the people living on that territory. 
In this context,
I would like to point out that Russia initially did everything it could to make
sure these disagreements could be resolved by peaceful means. However, the Kiev
officials have conducted two punitive operations on those territories and, apparently,
we are witnessing a third escalation. 
All these years – I want to stress this – all these years, the people living on those territories
have been literally tortured by constant shelling and blockades. As you know, the people living on those territories, close to the front line, so to speak, were in fact forced to seek shelter in their basements – where they now live with their
children. 
A peace plan was drafted during the negotiating process called the Minsk Package of Measures because, as you recall,
we met in the city of Minsk. But subsequent developments show that the Kiev
authorities are not planning to implement it, and they have publicly said so
many times at the top state level and at the level of Foreign Minister and Security
Council Secretary. Overall, everyone understands that they are not planning to do anything with regard to this Minsk Package of Measures.
Nevertheless, Russia has exerted
efforts and still continues to make efforts to resolve all the complicated aspects
and tragic developments by peaceful means, but we have what we have. 
Our goal, the goal of today’s meeting
is to listen to our colleagues and to outline future steps in this direction,
considering the appeals by the leaders of the Donetsk People’s Republic and the Lugansk People’s Republic on recognising their sovereignty, as well as a resolution
by the State Duma of the Russian Federation on the same subject. The latter
document urges the President to recognise the independence and sovereignty of the Donetsk People’s Republic and the Lugansk People’s Republic.
At the same time, I would like to note that these different matters are, nevertheless, closely linked with
matters of maintaining international security, on the European continent in particular,
because the use of Ukraine as a tool for confronting this country, Russia, of course, presents a major and serious threat to us.
This is why we have intensified our
work with our main partners in Washington and NATO over the past few months and in late 2021, so as to reach an eventual agreement on these security measures
and to ensure the country’s calm and successful development under peaceful
conditions. We see this as our number one objective and a top priority; instead
of confrontation, we need to maintain security and ensure conditions for our
development. 
But we must,
of course, understand the reality we live in. And, as I have said many times before,
if Russia faces the threat of Ukraine being accepted into the North Atlantic Alliance,
NATO, the threat against our country will increase because of Article 5 of the North
Atlantic Treaty that clearly states that all countries in the alliance must fight
on the side of their co-member in the event of an aggression against it. But since
nobody recognises the will expressed by the people of Crimea and Sevastopol, and Ukraine continues to insist that it is Ukrainian territory, there is a real threat
that they will try to take back the territory they believe is theirs using military
force. And they do say this in their documents, obviously. Then the entire North
Atlantic Alliance will have to get involved. 
As you know,
we have been told that some NATO countries are against Ukraine becoming a member.
However, despite their objections, in 2008, they signed a memorandum in Bucharest
that opened the doors for Ukraine and Georgia to join NATO. I have not received
an answer to my question as to why they did that. But if they took one step under
pressure from the United States, who can guarantee that they will not take another
step under pressure? There is no guarantee.
There are no
guarantees whatsoever because the United States is known to easily discard any agreements
and documents it signs. Still, at least something must be put on paper and formulated
as an international legal act. At this point, we cannot even agree on this one thing.

Therefore, I would like to suggest that we proceed as follows: first, I will give the floor to Mr Lavrov who is directly involved in the attempts to reach an agreement with Washington
and Brussels, and with NATO, on security guarantees. Then I would like Mr Kozak
to report on his findings concerning the talks on the implementation of the Minsk
agreements. Then each of you will be able to speak. But at the end of the day, we
must decide what we will do next and how we should proceed in view of the current
situation and our assessment of these developments. 
Mr Lavrov, please. 
I am talking to my colleagues about
this in fact, and my American colleague has assured me that they are not going
to admit Ukraine tomorrow; moreover, even a moratorium is possible. But they also
believe that Ukraine is not ready yet, so my answer was simple: “We do not see this
as a concession to us; it is just the implementation of your plans. You believe
you need to wait and prepare Ukraine for joining NATO. A moratorium, but not a moratorium for us; you are announcing this moratorium for yourself. So where is
the step towards us, to meet us halfway? So far, we have not seen this.”
I spoke twice to the President of France yesterday; actually, we spoke until 2 am this morning, so you could say we talked
today. He insists that the US position has undergone some changes. But regrettably, he was unable to answer the question of what those changes are. 
I think first we need to see what these changes are, if they exist at all, because your colleagues, to the contrary, publicly claimed as late as yesterday that there were no changes in the principal issues of expansion, of accepting new countries into NATO, including Ukraine. Do I understand it correctly?

I see, thank
you.
Take your
seat, please, Thank you.
Now, Mr Kozak will report – as I requested – on any developments on the Minsk settlement track, let us call it that. And after that, I would ask the other Security Council members to speak out starting with the real situation, which is
now unfolding in the Donetsk People’s Republic. 
Please, Mr
Kozak. 
No-no, please, tell us about the negotiating process on the Minsk agreements and its current status.
As I have already mentioned, yesterday I spoke
with my French counterpart once again. He claims that Ukraine’s incumbent
leadership is ready to implement the Minsk agreements and is even introducing
certain new constructive ideas on their implementation, such as an election
under the arrangement used for the election of German President Frank-Walter
Steinmeier     Steinmeier Frank-WalterPresident of the Federal Republic of Germany .
Meaning we don’t know what? We don’t know what provisions of the Minsk
Agreements Donbass is not complying with. 
Please explain once again about Clauses 9, 11 and 12 stating expressly
that decisions should be taken in dialogue with … 
During consultations and in dialogue with these republics. What do you have
to say on this matter? 
Do you mean that, in their opinion, the provision reading “during
dialogue and by agreement” does not mean direct dialogue?
o we understand you correctly thatthe Kiev authorities do not want to talk to the republics directly? They
say they intend to do this in dialogue with Russia, but as soon as Russia
suggests steps towards settlement as part of the Minsk Agreements, they throw a tantrum, claiming that Russia is interfering in Ukraine’s internal affairs?

Yes. And what about [their claim] that the Minsk Agreements should be
interpreted in such a way that it is the current Kiev official authorities,
rather than the unrecognised republics, that should introduce initiatives and proposals on how to implement the Minsk Package of Measures? 

Do I understand you correctly that the key provision of the Minsk Agreements
that all these amendments, including constitutional amendments, should be
coordinated with the Donetsk and Lugansk people’s republics, is being
disregarded?
 Ok. Then I have what I can call a final
question for this part. Tell me and our colleagues your opinion as to whether
or not the Kiev authorities will implement the Minsk Agreements? 

Ok.

Thank you, all right. 

Let us now confine ourselves to your remarks…

Mr Kozak, we will confine ourselves to your remarks on the negotiating process within
the framework of the Minsk Agreements and to your assessment of prospects. We
have understood that, in your opinion, there are no prospects for the development of the negotiating process within the framework of the Minsk Agreements.

Thank you. 
(Addressing Alexander
Bortnikov.) Now I would like to ask Director of the Federal Security Service, Mr Bortnikov,
to report on the situation at the border, including with regard to border officers
recording the number of people crossing our border, refugees, and on developments
at the border. 
Thank you.
Mr Shoigu, I know that
the Defence Ministry is monitoring the situation in the conflict zone. Please report.

Thank you.
Colleagues,
I think we are all aware of the status
of the negotiating process on the Donbass settlement. It has been described in sufficient detail by the Federal Security Service Director and the Defence Minister.
We need to give an answer to the question that was raised a long time ago and is included in the State Duma’s appeal
to the head of state. This question concerns recognising the Donetsk People's
Republic and the Lugansk People's Republic.
We see the threats and blackmail coming
from our Western colleagues, and we understand where this step stems from, but
we understand the situation at hand as well.
Mr Medvedev.
hank you.
Mr Medvedev, and I want to say this to all of you now: each of you knows
that I did not discuss anything with anyone in advance. I want to emphasise
this. I did not ask for your opinion in advance. What is happening now is happening,
so to say, unrehearsed, because I wanted to know what your opinion is without
any prior preparation. I believe this to be very important, and I would like the State Duma Speaker to express his opinion on this issue. 
Mr Volodin.

Thank you.
Ms Matviyenko.

Thank you.
Mr Patrushev.
Thank you.
Mr Mishustin.
So, you support the appeal by the State Duma?
Thank you.
Mr Naryshkin.

What does “otherwise” mean? Do you propose starting a negotiating process or recognising the sovereignty of the republics? Speak plainly.

Will support or support? Speak plainly, Mr Naryshkin.

Just say yes or no.

We are not talking about this, we are not discussing this. We are talking about
recognising their independence or not.

Good. Please take your seat. Thank you.
Mr
Kolokoltsev.
Thank you very much.
Regarding the negotiating process, Mr
Kozak reported it is at a dead end. We have been negotiating for eight years now.
This is what we are talking about.
All plenipotentiary envoys are present
here. I would like to ask one of you, say, Mr Shchegolev, to speak out. Of course, I expect you to express your own position, but we will assume that our
other colleagues adhere to approximately the same viewpoint. Should any envoy
feel the need to add something and express their point of view, they are
welcome to do so.
Please, go ahead.
Thank you.
I would like to ask all those
present here today, are there any other points of view or special opinions on this matter? None? I know the position of the Foreign Ministry, the Defence
Ministry, and the Federal Security Service. Nevertheless, I would like to hear
what you have to say.
Mr Lavrov, you have the floor.
Thank you. 
Mr Shoigu.
Thank you. 
Mr Zolotov. 
Fine. Thank you. 
Colleagues, I have heard your
opinions. The decision will be made later today. 
 I would like to thank you for this meeting, for this conference.
"
2021-07-13,"I decided to prepare this material a while ago, actually. I have been thinking about it for several months now.
The title of this material, or “article,” is just
a convention because it is still a bit more than just an article. It is analytical
material based on historical facts, events and historical documents.
Why did I have this idea at all? In our daily lives,
we work, bring up our children, go for a hobby. As a rule, we do not think much
about the issues in this article. However, the situation required that we look
more attentively at the world we live in, who we are, and what relations we
have with our closest relatives and neighbours. So, this idea came about in this
context.
But why did I start it at this particular time?
Because the conditions that are taking shape are fundamentally different from
what they were only recently. There is every indication that an anti-Russia agenda
is being pursued, and of course, this is bound to be of concern to us.
Yes, of course, every country has the right to choose
its own way, no question. But, you know, it is the same as with every person.
He is free but there is a well-known formula: the freedom of each person is
limited by the freedom of another person. If it contradicts the freedom of another
person, it is necessary to consider certain limits and self-restrictions. The same applies to countries. If we see that certain threats are being created,
especially in security, we must certainly decide what to do about it. And this
is a sincere conversation on all the subjects I just mentioned.
However, there are also certain circumstances
that compelled me to present this material today. After all, there are many people
in Ukraine, millions of people who want to restore relations with Russia. I am sure
there are millions of them. There are also political forces that advocate normalisation
in this respect. But, judging by what we see, they are being deprived of any opportunity
to implement their political goals. They are simply removed from the political
scene through non-systemic, illegal methods. Some are simply killed in the streets, and then after this kind of crime nobody looks for the criminal. Or people are burned alive, like the tragic events in Odessa.
National media are closed and people are put
under house arrest, like it’s happening now with Mr Medvedchuk. Indicatively, the Ukrainian authorities take completely illegal actions that are even outside
their competence. In other words, these forces are not given any chance for legal political work. This is another circumstance that I consider to be very important.
And lastly – I would like to return to what I started
with – it is essentially important for all of us to understand the current
situation based on the historical context of its roots.
I do not divide people into “them”
and “us.” In the article I also write that we are a common entity, and so it is
intended for all of us, including those who live in modern Russia, those who
live in modern Ukraine and the sponsors of the current political leadership of Ukraine. They should also know what we are and what we think about each other.
I believe that this is important for all of us.
I said frankly in the article that
the most dangerous time bomb is the right of the Soviet republics to freely
secede from the united country.
I would like to say that when the Soviet Union
was born after the First World War, even the Bolshevik leadership was divided
on that matter. I did not write about this in detail in my article, because I believe that such details would be superfluous. However, Stalin, who was
responsible for this sphere of activities in the Bolshevik party, had major
differences with Lenin. Stalin insisted on the principle of autonomisation
during the creation of the Soviet Union, believing that all the other Soviet
republics that were established in the former empire must be incorporated, yes,
incorporated, into the RSFSR.
Lenin had a different perspective. He spoke
about the equality of all the republics, which should not be incorporated into
the Russian Federation (RSFSR), but should establish new states on equal
conditions with it. Stalin described this as national liberalism and openly
argued with Lenin.
Incidentally, if we read some documents, we
will see that Lenin’s position was that Stalin was ultimately right, but it was
premature to speak about that. And Lenin made concessions to the national
republics, as Stalin described this. Stalin himself said that Russian
federalism was a period of transition to socialist centrism.
Actually, this is what the Bolsheviks really
did, because the Soviet Union, which was formally a federation, or possibly
even a confederation if we take into account the right to secede, essentially
was an extremely unitary centralised state. The right to secede was, of course,
one of the time bombs.
And the second time bomb, which I also mentioned,
was the leading role of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, its directing
and primary role. Why? Because it turned out that the party was the only thing
that kept the entire country together as a single state. As I wrote in the article, as soon as the party started to fall apart from the inside, the whole
country shattered. 
There were other time bombs as well. Perhaps we
will talk about this later on. 
 Of course, not. The details are all in there.
The project started back in the 17th and 18th centuries
in the Polish‒Lithuanian Commonwealth. It was later exploited by the Polish
national movement and, before World War I, it was used by the Austro-Hungarian
Empire. The goal was quite simple, as I wrote: divide and rule. Before World
War I, Russia’s potential opponents had a simple goal – to just weaken the country. They pursued this target vigorously, promoting the anti-Russia concept
and separating part of one nation in order to make the rival weaker. Why the Bolsheviks had to pick up that concept and implement it when building a union,
is not historically clear. 
Perhaps, at the time it would have been more
logical to bring the country together, especially because they believed it was
a transition period. But they left it as it was and, unfortunately, the time
bombs eventually detonated. 
So, it all started a long time ago, during the Middle Ages, and it continues to this very day. They are simply recycling old
schemes. History repeats itself. 
 No, of course, not. You know, in the Soviet
times there were attempts to eradicate religiousness among our people. Did they
succeed? When the Great Patriotic War broke out, during his speech on the radio, Vyacheslav Molotov addressed the nation as “fellow citizens.” But Joseph
Stalin, who spoke after we all realised the looming catastrophe of the war
started by Nazi Germany, addressed the nation as “brothers and sisters.” This
is what people call each other in church. Later, the patriarchate was restored.
Today, the church plays its well-deserved role in society. 
It is not gone; the triunity of our people has
never been and will never be gone, no matter how hard they try using the same
schemes as in the 17th and 18th centuries. 
I talked about this with the President of Belarus. He said that when he plays hockey and team members get angry because
somebody makes a mistake, in the heat of the moment they shout: “Come on, don’t
you get it? Are you not Russian?” Phrases like this one come out without
thinking, from the heart. There are millions of people like this in Ukraine,
too. So, no, it is not gone and it will never be gone. 
This does not imply our intersecting paths but, rather, interdependent
and interwoven destinies of millions of people living in contemporary Ukraine
and contemporary Russia. This amounts to the historical and spiritual
interweaving of our peoples that took centuries to evolve. What the incumbent
authorities are saying has nothing to do with the people. The authorities are
talking about their own personal choice. But this does not necessarily mean that
this choice is final. 
Going back to your first question as to why this material appeared
precisely now, I would address the matter from another angle. This material
appeared following the drafting and enactment of the law on indigenous peoples.
I will repeat the gist of the matter. The law declares Russian people living on historical Russian territories to be aliens. In effect, the authorities are
beginning to expel them from this territory. This is what is happening. So,
this was one of the factors that motivated me to write the article. 
As to whom all this is addressed to,
and what I had in mind when I was talking about what we have just mentioned, I would just like to note one aspect: People living in Ukraine are unlikely to look calmly at incumbent rulers who gain power under certain slogans and who
later change their colour just like chameleons and defend entirely different
positions. As a rule, they defend the interests of their superiors and those
financing their stay in power, rather than the interests of the Ukrainian people.
 If they want to have a discussion, I think
they should take a break, read the article carefully, analyse it and review
some of the archival material. I think this is exactly what they will do and they will find something to talk about. When I say “they” I mean the political
leadership of today’s Ukraine. These debates have been going on for a long time
now. It is hard to argue with this article because it is honest and it is in fact based on historical documents. They may be subject to different
interpretations, it is true. But the basis for the article is historical
archives. 
What can I say about the gas issue? Russia,
Gazprom, we signed a five-year contract to deliver a certain amount of Russian natural
gas to our consumers in Europe via Ukraine. The Normandy format and other
similar formats are political platforms for discussing the situation in southeastern Ukraine. They have nothing to do with commercial projects like
Nord Stream or Nord Stream 2 or the transit of our gas through the territory of Ukraine. Despite all the current difficulties, Russia undertook certain
obligations under this contract and will fully meet them. 
 It does not only depend on us. On the international stage, building a certain type of relationship even between the closest
neighbours is always a compromise. It is not our goal to force anybody into
adopting a certain model. We are looking for a compromise. 
Here is what I mean: it does not matter to us
how a neighbouring state – in this case, Ukraine – will shape its foreign policy
and its roadmap. What matters is (and I said the same thing about freedom) that
nobody creates problems or threats for us. What we see, however, is that
military development of this territory is starting, which is worrying. I have
expressed my opinion about this issue multiple times. And I think that our
concerns will eventually be heard by those involved. After all, it is not
Ukraine’s doing. It is happening on Ukrainian territory and people are being
used. I really do hope that our concerns will be taken seriously. 
Regarding other countries, if you are hinting that it discusses the evolution of these republics – this republic in this case, then other republics also evolved in the same manner. Yes, this is so. But I have noted there that contemporary Russia recognises current geopolitical realities. We have recognised current geopolitical realities.
Naturally, we are worried about hypothetical threats. But we maintain allied and friendly relations like with Kazakhstan and many other former Soviet republics, we work with some of them on a bilateral basis in an absolutely friendly manner. We set up economic alliances with some of them. We also set up defensive alliances, including the Collective Security Treaty Organisation, or the Customs Union first and then the Eurasian Economic Union. We are not dragging anyone there. I repeat, we are looking for compromise solutions that create a situation that our partners feel satisfied with. This amounts to a complicated coordination process. But we are patient and search for mutually acceptable solutions that suit all of us. This is an ideal scenario.
See for yourself: The European Union continues to develop, and nobody compares it with the Soviet Union. Although I have already mentioned this, the number of mandatory decisions, passed by the European Parliament, exceeds the number of similar mandatory decisions, passed by the Supreme Soviet (Parliament) of the USSR. Nobody compares them with the Soviet Union. This is voluntary business. We will be completely satisfied if we can maintain friendly and stable relations even in a bilateral format. And we are ready for this, I repeat again, while recognising current geopolitical realities. The situation is even better if we establish relations similar to those we have with Kazakhstan or Belarus, with which we are building a Union State, this is even better. We are also ready for such profound cooperation. 
By the way, we are talking here about the Russia-Belarus Union State. This is not a state in the direct sense of the word but, rather, a certain level of integration. If we compare the Russia-Belarus Union State with the European Union, the EU boasts much more profound integration levels. These levels are much deeper. They have a common currency, an extremely powerful customs union, etc. They also have a common space and stipulate visa-free travel. We have so far failed to attain EU levels; at the same time, the EU countries completely retain their sovereignty. Nevertheless, this makes people’s life easier, creates certain conditions for economic development and boosts our common competitiveness. If relations develop in this context, we will, of course, support such relations. We advocate this concept and we will work with all our neighbours and friends in a partner-like manner.
"
2020-10-06,"Mr Medvedchuk, I am pleased to have you here.
I have known for a long time now that
despite the many challenges you maintain a straightforward position on restoring
Ukrainian-Russian relations at all levels, including state, non-governmental,
and in the economy.
We are pleased to know that there
are political forces in Ukraine that openly and honestly hold this position. For our part, we are ready to contribute to restoring Russian-Ukrainian relations
in every way. We hope that you will have more supporters in this regard over
time. To reiterate, for our part, we will do our best to restore our relations.
I would like to note that we in Russia also noticed how the 75th anniversary of Victory over Nazism
was celebrated in Ukraine this year. I am aware that this is largely due to your efforts, and the efforts of your associates and your party. I am confident
that many people in Ukraine are grateful to you for this.
Since this is our common victory, I would like to express our gratitude to you on behalf of the Russian people.
I can say right away that this is possible. This vaccine has already
arrived in all our regions. Unfortunately, it is not yet being produced in sufficient quantity. We need millions of doses.
As you may know, we are now working on it with our colleagues and friends in Belarus. We recently discussed this matter
with Mr Lukashenko. The work there is on schedule as well.
Indeed, many research centres worldwide
are working on it, and we wish everyone success. Some of our major institutions
in St Petersburg and Novosibirsk are researching it as well. In Moscow, work
continues at the Gamaleya Centre and other places. I hope that another Russian
vaccine will be registered in the middle of October, just ten days from now. It
is almost finished, and the work on it has been completed. I am referring to the Novosibirsk centre Vektor.
With regard to the vaccine you
mentioned, yes, of course. Indeed, why not? If we started working with Belarus,
we could work with Ukraine as well.
We would need to implement this plan
in conjunction with the specialists from Ukraine. The official Ukrainian authorities
should formulate their requests and needs accordingly. We are ready to do this
regardless of the political difficulties. After all, this is a purely
humanitarian matter, a healthcare issue, a matter of caring for the people we
care about be it Russia or Ukraine.
So, we are ready to do this work. To reiterate, the corresponding authorities must come to an agreement at the official level.
Did you have a fever?
We here in Russia are discussing this topic constantly. Our people are
aware that there may be fever or body aches.
This is natural for some types of vaccination. But it does not happen when
some types of vaccines are used. At any rate this happens sometimes and it is
necessary to know this. Many of my associates and close relatives have already
been vaccinated, as well as employees working around me, dozens of people, about
50. Maybe seven or eight people had a fever. Their temperature was not too high
but still higher than normal. But, reliable protection has been created. So again,
we are certainly ready to do this with Ukraine.
Do you mean yourself?
Almost all top-ranking officials at our Defence Ministry have been
vaccinated.
s well as those from other security services.
Mr Medvedchuk, the first issue you touched upon, fighting the coronavirus, is a purely humanitarian matter.
The second issue has more specifics
to it, which you have just touched upon. These specifics boil down to the fact
that we did not impose the sanctions. Everything we do, we do in response and with regard to the states that have taken certain steps with regard to Russia,
against Russia.
I know what you are trying to say.
And my heart aches from knowing that people in Ukraine who worked at the enterprises
that sent their output to Russia found themselves in a difficult situation.
This is the most important thing. I would like to fix this, of course. We are
ready to do this. We want this situation to go back to normal. But we cannot
make any exceptions from the list of the countries that have imposed sanctions on us. This is the main problem.
Nevertheless, we still need to prepare for this. Someday, I hope, this will come to pass. In this sense, of course, we probably need the Government to work on it as well.
You just mentioned a public organisation.
We could work on this with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry and other
associations of entrepreneurs and, of course, the Government. I will ask my colleagues to set up a meeting with you and get this work going.
I will let Mr Mishustin know.
 <…>
"
2020-03-10," Mr
Medvedchuk, you once told me about your idea of creating a parliamentary
dimension of the Normandy format, and Mr Volodin has recently reminded me about
this. I believe it is a good idea. We discussed this idea some time ago; I do
not remember exactly when it was.
Of course, I believe that this would be quite
appropriate, if members of parliament in Ukraine, Russia, Germany and France
support what is being done at the executive level. I strongly hope that you
will succeed, with support from the Administration of the Ukrainian President.
For our part, we are ready to join this project at any time.
I also know about the attitude of our French
and German colleagues to this idea. I can only wish you success.
This is highly desirable. Mr Volodin, will you support this?
There is no need to prompt them, they are experienced people. I believe
that they will support and follow through. 
 <…>
"
2019-09-05,"Mr Medvedchuk, do you like it here
[at the Eastern Economic Forum]?
Look, Prime Minister Abe is here at the Eastern Economic Forum for the third time running
and for you, Mr Medvedchuk, this is the first time …
this is wrong. It is right to come here. I still think, as everyone knows, that the best market for Ukrainian goods is in Russia.
Although there are, of course, very many interesting partners here. The Asia-Pacific region is seen as a place of interest by Russia and all countries,
including Ukraine. All of us realise that this region of the world posts the most rapid economic development rates. 
I hope that your stay here was
interesting.
I know that you have been doing this for a long time. To be honest,
everyone knows that you have been doing this for many years, and this is such a noble and humanitarian mission. One should say that it is also quite
successful. Therefore, you very successfully convert our kind attitude into specific
humanitarian events and specific deeds.
I believe that people will remember
this. Understandably, this is a noble undertaking, although we voice a special
position on these two individuals mentioned by you.
his is a complicated matter for us. Certainly, we will move in this
direction in the near future, just like we had agreed with the incumbent
official authorities in Ukraine, and we will jointly announce specific
decisions, due to be made.
e are working on it.
hank you for your efforts. And I hope that your stay will be both interesting
and successful. Do please come back.
<…>
"
2019-07-18,"First of all, thank you for finding
it possible to come and talk about the outcome of your meetings in Strasbourg.
I think that the involvement of European partners – and they have been
involved in one way or another from the start, unfortunately even from the beginning
of the conflict, which eventually became what we see now in Donbass – the involvement of European partners is a very positive thing. And we welcome it in every way. 
And we also welcome the fact that your proposal
is based on the Minsk agreements, and there is no doubt that we will support
any political forces moving in that direction. 
Comprehensive restoration of Russian-Ukrainian
relations is extremely important for us too, and we will cooperate with any
political force, including yours, to restore full-fledged relations between
Russia and Ukraine. This also concerns resolving problems in Donbass and our
bilateral relations in the economy. 
Naturally, the Government reports to me about
your meetings and topics that you discuss. I think that everything that you
talked about with the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation and representatives of the economic and energy blocks can be implemented. You and I also talked about it on many occasions. So, we will work on it.
he only thing that I wanted to point out is what you just said, in particular, that a comprehensive
settlement in the south-east, in Donbass, is only possible through direct
contact between the authorities in Kiev and representatives of those republics,
and that not a single conflict in the world in recent history has been resolved …
es, without direct
talks between the conflicting parties. 
We will also do our utmost so that the process moves
along smoothly at the right pace. 
I want to also thank you for your efforts over
the recent years, the efforts regarding the release of persons detained on both
sides. I think that such humanitarian work will always be welcomed by everybody
because this activity brings about favourable outcomes in peoples’ lives. There
is nothing more important in terms of any political force’s work then when its
activity produces favourable results in the lives of particular people and families. I think that people will always sincerely thank you for this. 
"
2015-12-09," Colleagues, as we agreed, we are meeting
today to discuss matters concerning implementation of the Presidential Address
to the Federal Assembly, delivered on December 3, 2015. Mr Shuvalov is the main
speaker, and everyone else will have the chance to say a few words. 
But I want to start with an update
from the Energy Minister on the situation with power supply for Crimea. 
Please, Mr Novak. 
Good. When will the second section
come on line?
Firstly, we need to resume coal
supplies to Ukraine. They have switched only one line back on, but it is on,
and so we need to resume coal supplies. 
Secondly, once we are able to cover
in full the energy supply that Crimea was receiving from Ukraine, and have all
four sections in operation, we cannot have on-going contracts for energy
supplies from Ukraine to Crimea if they are no longer needed. As far as I know,
we have no such contracts, but we need to take a closer look so as not to put
anyone in a difficult situation, and we need to give advance warning that from
such and such a date, we will no longer need energy supplies. In principle,
these supplies are not really needed now, if we use the mobile generating
capacity, but our Ukrainian partners have resumed supply. So be it. If they
have restored supply, we will take what they have restored. In response, we
need to resume our coal supplies to Ukraine.
I have a question regarding our loan
in this respect. The deadline has already come for payment of $3 billion. We
know all that was involved in this matter. Everyone knows the proposals we made
to our partners in the United States and Europe. We were ready to restructure
the debt for a four-year period. We were willing to skip the 2015 payment and then those in 2016, 2017, and 2018, but under guarantees from those who were
asking us to do this, of course. If they are confident that Ukraine is
sufficiently solvent to pay all 3 billion next year, there is also the possibility of spreading the payment over four years, which is a much milder
proposal. As you recall, we asked the United States, Europe, or one of the top-level international banks to share these risks with us, and we would be
ready to support Ukraine in these conditions. What response has come from our
partners? Has there been a response? 
The Europeans have made no official
response? 
You wrote to him? 
And the Americans have said
directly that they will not give guarantees. 
With whom we had spoken? 
That’s strange. If they are so
confident that Ukraine will be solvent next year, they could take part in sharing the risks with us for these four years. It’s hard to understand. Well,
so be it. Turn to the courts then, what else can we do? 
Mr Nikiforov, what is the situation
with mobile communications in Crimea? 

Good. I ask you to keep monitoring this situation and take measures if any
breakdowns occur. 
To finish with these problems, I met
in Antalya with the German Chancellor and with Mr Juncker, the head of the European Commission, and we discussed our relations in the trilateral
Russia-EU-Ukraine format in connection with the association agreement between
Ukraine and the European Union, which essentially establishes a free market
between Ukraine and the EU. 
In this respect, we have already
been discussing for some time now what can be done to address Russia’s
concerns, given that Ukraine is also a member of the CIS free trade zone. I know that our partners sent us proposals from Brussels that would be difficult
for us to fulfil. For those not aware of the details, I can tell you that one
of the demands is that we change the CIS’ customs rules. It is laughable even
to discuss the idea that we would unilaterally take on such an obligation
without first holding consultations with all of the CIS countries. This is
simply absurd.
Or we are supposed to commit
ourselves to adopting the Europeans’ phytosanitary inspection information
system, in other words, adopt the EU phytosanitary control system, which in principle might not be a bad idea, and perhaps we will eventually do this, but
it would take time and a certain effort.
The same goes for technical
standards. This document states that all goods sold on the Ukrainian market
should comply with European technical standards. This means that practically
none of our goods could be sold in Ukraine. This is the way it looks formally,
at any rate. 
We have spoken about all of these
concerns with our partners and have been trying to reach agreement with them on all these points for the last year. We received this document just recently,
met with our colleagues from Europe, discussed it, and once again, together
with them, went through the concerns and problems that we propose resolving
through talks.
After our meeting, Economic
Development Minister, Mr Ulyukayev, flew directly from Paris to Brussels to continue this discussion with the colleagues. Mr Ulyukayev, how did that
discussion end?
ustoms information exchange?
etermining the country of origin.
 see. As far as I understand, the Europeans agreed to transition
periods for individual sectors for only one area: high-speed rail links. That
is the sector where we are working very actively with German companies. This is
very noble on their part, apparently very good, but as I understand from our
Minister, this is not enough for us.
 see.
ll right. In spite of all these complications, I will ask you to nevertheless continue this discussion with the hope of reaching some sort of agreement before January 1, 2016.
"
2015-04-08,"r Miller, you wanted to report on the work
with our close partners in Ukraine.
y lowering it.
et’s proceed on the basis that you will maintain normal business
relations so that our partners can feel confident concerning our intentions. We
certainly want them to be confident that we will not use our economic ties as some sort of lever to resolve other issues that are unrelated to the economy.
We have never done this in the past, and they should feel confident that we
will not do this in the future. So please aim to abide by and strictly adhere
to the demands of the 2009 contract.
As for the discounts, we will need
to use them in such a way that the price for Ukraine is comparable to the regional
prices – meaning, the nations neighbouring Ukraine.
 agree. Given the problems of the Ukrainian economy, we must help our
partners. And another issue: we must ensure uninterrupted gas supplies to all
partners, including in southeast Ukraine. 
 <…>
"
2015-02-20,"Good afternoon colleagues.
I want to start by asking Mr Medvedev to brief us on the situation with energy supplies to our neighbour, Ukraine. We have been receiving different information on this matter. The Government has already taken the relevant decisions.
Mr Medvedev, what is actually happening?
hat about the gas supply situation in general in Ukraine?
Ukraine’s gas consumers asked for an increase on the volumes initially agreed.
They are asking for around three times more gas than before?
I ask the Russian Government to keep to the contract obligations and act in strict accordance with them.
"
2014-07-21," In response to the terrible tragedy that took place over Donetsk, I want to reiterate Russia’s position with regard to the current situation in Ukraine.
We have called repeatedly on all parties to the conflict to stop the bloodshed immediately and begin negotiations. I believe that if military operations had not resumed in eastern Ukraine on June 28, this tragedy probably could have been avoided.
At the same time, no one should and no one has the right to use this tragedy to pursue their own political goals. Rather than dividing us, tragedies of this sort should bring people together. All those who are responsible for the situation in the region must take greater responsibility before their own peoples and before the peoples of the countries whose citizens were killed in this disaster. 
Everything possible must be done to ensure that international experts can work in safety at the crash site. Representatives from the Donbass region, Donetsk, Ukraine’s Emergency Situations Ministry, and Malaysian experts are already working at the site, but this is not enough. 
It is essential that a full-fledged group of experts under ICAO aegis, an appropriate international commission set up for the task, be able to work at the crash site. We must do everything possible to ensure their complete and guaranteed safety and provide them with the humanitarian corridors they need for their work. 
For its part, Russia will do everything within its power to move the conflict in eastern Ukraine from the military phase we see today to the negotiating phase, with the parties using peaceful and diplomatic means alone.
"
2014-04-19," I have already hinted at that before.
 I do not think we will find out in the short term, but the people will be rewarded by the state, that is for sure.
 I know and I said it deliberately. However, if we take a frank and fair look at this, we will all see that you cannot force people out of their homes and make them vote even at gunpoint, while 83% of the population came to the polling stations.
 There is an enormous difference: in the North Caucasus we were dealing with aggression on the part of international terrorism. These were specially formed, well-trained gangs armed and supplied by other countries. This is a huge difference.
 You will have to ask him.
 This has nothing to do with the elections. We are not linking economic issues to the political developments in Ukraine. We were supposed to receive payment for March gas deliveries on April 7 this year. We never received it. I would like to repeat: we are talking about $525 million. Zero! We are acting in full compliance with the contract – and we are charging the lowest rate, with all the discounts. As we agreed, if they do not make regular payments, we will get back to the initial pricing formula. In line with the contract, it amounts to $485 per 1,000 cubic metres.
We say we could have done this right now, considering the accumulated debt of $2.2 billion, but we will not do so. We do not want to either destabilise the Ukrainian economy or question the reliability of gas transit to Europe, therefore we call on all European states, all countries that are interested in supporting the Ukrainian economy to get involved in providing assistance to Ukraine and work out a set of measures designed to fund the budget.
We are willing to wait another month, but we cannot wait forever, we cannot shift the entire burden of supporting a 45-million strong nation onto the Russian budget and the Russian taxpayers.
 This does not make much difference – Ukraine will have to find the rubles anyway.
 No, he did not visit me – I went to Denmark.
 Yes, he did.
 We are on very good terms, personally as well as officially. He is a very serious, responsible person. We will see how our relations develop once he assumes his new post.
 You know, this is not for us to decide, or not only for us. This depends on our partners. I do not see anything that would stand in the way of normalising our cooperation.
 Thank you.
"
2014-03-04," Good afternoon, colleagues,
How shall we do this? This is what I’d like to suggest: let’s have a conversation, rather than an interview. Therefore, I would ask you to begin by stating all your questions, I will jot them down and try to answer them, and then we will have a more detailed discussion of the specifics that interest you most.
Let’s begin.
 Fine, let us stop here for now. I will begin, and then we will continue. Don’t worry; I will try to answer as many questions as possible.
First of all, my assessment of what happened in Kiev and in Ukraine in general. There can only be one assessment: this was an anti-constitutional takeover, an armed seizure of power. Does anyone question this? Nobody does. There is a question here that neither I, nor my colleagues, with whom I have been discussing the situation in Ukraine a great deal over these past days, as you know – none of us can answer. The question is why was this done?
I would like to draw your attention to the fact that President Yanukovych, through the mediation of the Foreign Ministers of three European countries – Poland, Germany and France – and in the presence of my representative (this was the Russian Human Rights Commissioner Vladimir Lukin) signed an agreement with the opposition on February 21. I would like to stress that under that agreement (I am not saying this was good or bad, just stating the fact) Mr Yanukovych actually handed over power. He agreed to all the opposition’s demands: he agreed to early parliamentary elections, to early presidential elections, and to return to the 2004 Constitution, as demanded by the opposition. He gave a positive response to our request, the request of western countries and, first of all, of the opposition not to use force. He did not issue a single illegal order to shoot at the poor demonstrators. Moreover, he issued orders to withdraw all police forces from the capital, and they complied. He went to Kharkov to attend an event, and as soon as he left, instead of releasing the occupied administrative buildings, they immediately occupied the President’s residence and the Government building – all that instead of acting on the agreement.
I ask myself, what was the purpose of all this? I want to understand why this was done. He had in fact given up his power already, and as I believe, as I told him, he had no chance of being re-elected. Everybody agrees on this, everyone I have been speaking to on the telephone these past few days. What was the purpose of all those illegal, unconstitutional actions, why did they have to create this chaos in the country? Armed and masked militants are still roaming the streets of Kiev. This is a question to which there is no answer. Did they wish to humiliate someone and show their power? I think these actions are absolutely foolish. The result is the absolute opposite of what they expected, because their actions have significantly destabilised the east and southeast of Ukraine.
Now over to how this situation came about.
In my opinion, this revolutionary situation has been brewing for a long time, since the first days of Ukraine’s independence. The ordinary Ukrainian citizen, the ordinary guy suffered during the rule of Nicholas II, during the reign of Kuchma, and Yushchenko, and Yanukovych. Nothing or almost nothing has changed for the better. Corruption has reached dimensions that are unheard of here in Russia. Accumulation of wealth and social stratification – problems that are also acute in this country – are much worse in Ukraine, radically worse. Out there, they are beyond anything we can imagine. Generally, people wanted change, but one should not support illegal change.
Only constitutional means should be used on the post-Soviet space, where political structures are still very fragile, and economies are still weak. Going beyond the constitutional field would always be a cardinal mistake in such a situation. Incidentally, I understand those people on Maidan, though I do not support this kind of turnover. I understand the people on Maidan who are calling for radical change rather than some cosmetic remodelling of power. Why are they demanding this? Because they have grown used to seeing one set of thieves being replaced by another. Moreover, the people in the regions do not even participate in forming their own regional governments. There was a period in this country when the President appointed regional leaders, but then the local legislative authorities had to approve them, while in Ukraine they are appointed directly. We have now moved on to elections, while they are nowhere near this. And they began appointing all sorts of oligarchs and billionaires to govern the eastern regions of the country. No wonder the people do not accept this, no wonder they think that as a result of dishonest privatisation (just as many people think here as well) people have become rich and now they also have been brought to power.
For example, Mr Kolomoisky was appointed Governor of Dnepropetrovsk. This is a unique crook. He even managed to cheat our oligarch Roman Abramovich two or three years ago. Scammed him, as our intellectuals like to say. They signed some deal, Abramovich transferred several billion dollars, while this guy never delivered and pocketed the money. When I asked him [Abramovich]: “Why did you do it?” he said: “I never thought this was possible.” I do not know, by the way, if he ever got his money back and if the deal was closed. But this really did happen a couple of years ago. And now this crook is appointed Governor of Dnepropetrovsk. No wonder the people are dissatisfied. They were dissatisfied and will remain so if those who refer to themselves as the legitimate authorities continue in the same fashion.
Most importantly, people should have the right to determine their own future, that of their families and of their region, and to have equal participation in it. I would like to stress this: wherever a person lives, whatever part of the country, he or she should have the right to equal participation in determining the future of the country.
Are the current authorities legitimate? The Parliament is partially, but all the others are not. The current Acting President is definitely not legitimate. There is only one legitimate President, from a legal standpoint. Clearly, he has no power. However, as I have already said, and will repeat: Yanukovych is the only undoubtedly legitimate President.
There are three ways of removing a President under Ukrainian law: one is his death, the other is when he personally steps down, and the third is impeachment. The latter is a well-deliberated constitutional norm. It has to involve the Constitutional Court, the Supreme Court and the Rada. This is a complicated and lengthy procedure. It was not carried out. Therefore, from a legal perspective this is an undisputed fact.
Moreover, I think this may be why they disbanded the Constitutional Court, which runs counter to all legal norms of both Ukraine and Europe. They not only disbanded the Constitutional Court in an illegitimate fashion, but they also – just think about it – instructed the Prosecutor General’s Office to launch criminal proceedings against members of the Constitutional Court. What is that all about? Is this what they call free justice? How can you instruct anyone to start criminal proceedings? If a crime, a criminal offence, has been committed, the law enforcement agencies see this and react. But instructing them to file criminal charges is nonsense, it’s monkey business.
Now about financial aid to Crimea. As you may know, we have decided to organise work in the Russian regions to aid Crimea, which has turned to us for humanitarian support. We will provide it, of course. I cannot say how much, when or how – the Government is working on this, by bringing together the regions bordering on Crimea, by providing additional support to our regions so they could help the people in Crimea. We will do it, of course.
Regarding the deployment of troops, the use of armed forces. So far, there is no need for it, but the possibility remains. I would like to say here that the military exercises we recently held had nothing to do with the events in Ukraine. This was pre-planned, but we did not disclose these plans, naturally, because this was a snap inspection of the forces’ combat readiness. We planned this a long time ago, the Defence Minister reported to me and I had the order ready to begin the exercise. As you may know, the exercises are over; I gave the order for the troops to return to their regular dislocations yesterday.
What can serve as a reason to use the Armed Forces? Such a measure would certainly be the very last resort.
First, the issue of legitimacy. As you may know, we have a direct appeal from the incumbent and, as I said, legitimate President of Ukraine, Mr Yanukovych, asking us to use the Armed Forces to protect the lives, freedom and health of the citizens of Ukraine.
What is our biggest concern? We see the rampage of reactionary forces, nationalist and anti-Semitic forces going on in certain parts of Ukraine, including Kiev. I am sure you, members of the media, saw how one of the governors was chained and handcuffed to something and they poured water over him, in the cold of winter. After that, by the way, he was locked up in a cellar and tortured. What is all this about? Is this democracy? Is this some manifestation of democracy? He was actually only recently appointed to this position, in December, I believe. Even if we accept that they are all corrupt there, he had barely had time to steal anything.
And do you know what happened when they seized the Party of Regions building? There were no party members there at all at the time. Some two-three employees came out, one was an engineer, and he said to the attackers: “Could you let us go, and let the women out, please. I’m an engineer, I have nothing to do with politics.” He was shot right there in front of the crowd. Another employee was led to a cellar and then they threw Molotov cocktails at him and burned him alive. Is this also a manifestation of democracy?
When we see this we understand what worries the citizens of Ukraine, both Russian and Ukrainian, and the Russian-speaking population in the eastern and southern regions of Ukraine. It is this uncontrolled crime that worries them. Therefore, if we see such uncontrolled crime spreading to the eastern regions of the country, and if the people ask us for help, while we already have the official request from the legitimate President, we retain the right to use all available means to protect those people. We believe this would be absolutely legitimate. This is our last resort.
Moreover, here is what I would like to say: we have always considered Ukraine not only a neighbour, but also a brotherly neighbouring republic, and will continue to do so. Our Armed Forces are comrades in arms, friends, many of whom know each other personally. I am certain, and I stress, I am certain that the Ukrainian military and the Russian military will not be facing each other, they will be on the same side in a fight.
Incidentally, the things I am talking about – this unity – is what is happening in Crimea. You should note that, thank God, not a single gunshot has been fired there; there are no casualties, except for that crush on the square about a week ago. What was going on there? People came, surrounded units of the armed forces and talked to them, convincing them to follow the demands and the will of the people living in that area. There was not a single armed conflict, not a single gunshot.
Thus the tension in Crimea that was linked to the possibility of using our Armed Forces simply died down and there was no need to use them. The only thing we had to do, and we did it, was to enhance the defence of our military facilities because they were constantly receiving threats and we were aware of the armed nationalists moving in. We did this, it was the right thing to do and very timely. Therefore, I proceed from the idea that we will not have to do anything of the kind in eastern Ukraine.
There is something I would like to stress, however. Obviously, what I am going to say now is not within my authority and we do not intend to interfere. However, we firmly believe that all citizens of Ukraine, I repeat, wherever they live, should be given the same equal right to participate in the life of their country and in determining its future.
If I were in the shoes of those who consider themselves the legitimate authorities, I would not waste time and go through all the necessary procedures, because they do not have a national mandate to conduct the domestic, foreign and economic policy of Ukraine, and especially to determine its future.
Now, the stock market. As you may know, the stock market was jumpy even before the situation in Ukraine deteriorated. This is primarily linked to the policy of the US Federal Reserve, whose recent decisions enhanced the attractiveness of investing in the US economy and investors began moving their funds from the developing markets to the American market. This is a general trend and it has nothing to do with Ukraine. I believe it was India that suffered most, as well as the other BRICS   Background information BRICS    states. Russia was hit as well, not as hard as India, but it was. This is the fundamental reason.
As for the events in Ukraine, politics always influence the stock market in one way or another. Money likes quiet, stability and calm. However, I think this is a tactical, temporary development and a temporary influence.
Your questions, please.
 Regarding the expected reaction, whether the G8 will meet and about the conversations. Our conversations are confidential, some are even held over secure lines. Therefore, I am not authorised to disclose what I discussed with my partners. I will, however, refer to some public statements made by my colleagues from the west; without giving any names, I will comment on them in a general sense.
What do we pay attention to? We are often told our actions are illegitimate, but when I ask, “Do you think everything you do is legitimate?” they say “yes”. Then, I have to recall the actions of the United States in Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya, where they either acted without any UN sanctions or completely distorted the content of such resolutions, as was the case with Libya. There, as you may know, the resolution only spoke of closing the airspace for government aircraft, while it all ended with bomb attacks and special forces land operations.
Our partners, especially in the United Sates, always clearly formulate their own geopolitical and state interests and follow them with persistence. Then, using the principle “You’re either with us or against us” they draw the whole world in. And those who do not join in get ‘beaten’ until they do.
Our approach is different. We proceed from the conviction that we always act legitimately. I have personally always been an advocate of acting in compliance with international law. I would like to stress yet again that if we do make the decision, if I do decide to use the Armed Forces, this will be a legitimate decision in full compliance with both general norms of international law, since we have the appeal of the legitimate President, and with our commitments, which in this case coincide with our interests to protect the people with whom we have close historical, cultural and economic ties. Protecting these people is in our national interests. This is a humanitarian mission. We do not intend to subjugate anyone or to dictate to anyone. However, we cannot remain indifferent if we see that they are being persecuted, destroyed and humiliated. However, I sincerely hope it never gets to that.
 Regarding sanctions. It is primarily those who intend to apply them that need to consider their consequences. I believe that in the modern world, where everything is interconnected and interdependent, it is possible to cause damage to another country, but this will be mutual damage and one should bear this in mind. This is one thing.
The second and the most important thing. I have already told you what motivates us. And what motivates our partners? They supported an unconstitutional armed take-over, declared these people legitimate and are trying to support them. By the way, despite all of this we have been patient and even ready to cooperate; we do not want to disrupt our cooperation. As you may know, a few days ago I instructed the Government to consider how we can maintain contacts even with those powers in Kiev that we do not consider legitimate in order to retain our ties in the economy and industry. We think our actions have been absolutely reasonable, while any threat against Russia is counterproductive and harmful.
As for the G8, I do not know. We will be ready to host the summit with our colleagues. If they do not want to come – so be it.
 I have just spoken about it. You must have missed it.
 I do not have a partner at the top level there. There is no president there, and there cannot be one until the general elections.
As for Crimea, the Parliament there was formed in 2010, in December 2010 if I remember correctly. There are 100 MPs representing six political parties. After the previous Prime Minister resigned, the Crimean Parliament, in compliance with the existing legislation and procedures elected a new Prime Minister at a session of the Crimean Supreme Council. He is definitely legitimate. They have complied with all the procedures envisaged by the law; there is not a single violation. However, when a few days ago a group of armed men tried to occupy the building of the Crimean Supreme Soviet, this caused the concern of the local residents. It seemed as though someone wanted to apply the Kiev scenario in Crimea and to launch a series of terrorist attacks and cause chaos. Naturally, this causes grave concern among the local residents. That is why they set up self-defence committees and took control over all the armed forces.
Incidentally, I was studying the brief yesterday to see what they took over – it is like a fortified zone. There are several dozen C-300 units, several dozen air-defence missile systems, 22,000 service members and a lot more. However, as I said, this is all in the hands of the people of Crimea and without a single gunshot.
 Why don’t you take a look at the post-Soviet states. There are many uniforms there that are similar. You can go to a store and buy any kind of uniform.
 Those were local self-defence units.
 My dear colleague, look how well trained the people who operated in Kiev were. As we all know they were trained at special bases in neighbouring states: in Lithuania, Poland and in Ukraine itself too. They were trained by instructors for extended periods. They were divided into dozens and hundreds, their actions were coordinated, they had good communication systems. It was all like clockwork. Did you see them in action? They looked very professional, like special forces. Why do you think those in Crimea should be any worse?
 No, we did not.
 No, we do not. Generally, I believe that only residents of a given country who have the freedom of will and are in complete safety can and should determine their future. If this right was granted to the Albanians in Kosovo, if this was made possible in many different parts of the world, then nobody has ruled out the right of nations to self-determination, which, as far as I know, is fixed by several UN documents. However, we will in no way provoke any such decision and will not breed such sentiments.
I would like to stress that I believe only the people living in a given territory have the right to determine their own future.
ou know, some people, including those who were recently among the protestors, have expressed the opinion that these were provocateurs from one of the opposition parties. Have you heard this?
ook at these materials – they are freely available. That is why it is very difficult to get to the bottom of the situation. But you and I saw for ourselves when the Berkut fighters stood there with their shields and were shot at – and those were not air weapons that were used against them but assault weapons that pierced their shields. That is something we saw for certain. As for who gave the orders – that I do not know. I only know what Mr Yanukovych told me. And he told me that he did not give any orders, and moreover, he gave instructions – after signing a corresponding agreement – to even withdraw all militia units from the capital.
If you want, I can tell you even more. He called me on the phone and I told him not to do it. I said, “You will have anarchy, you will have chaos in the capital. Think about the people.” But he did it anyway. And as soon as he did it, his office was seized, and that of the government, and the chaos I had warned him about and which continues to this day, erupted.
 am not concerned, because we do not plan and we will not fight with the Ukrainian people.
isten carefully. I want you to understand me clearly: if we make that decision, it will only be to protect Ukrainian citizens. And let’s see those troops try to shoot their own people, with us behind them – not in the front, but behind. Let them just try to shoot at women and children! I would like to see those who would give that order in Ukraine.
es, this issue is of great concern to us. After all, these are not Russia’s Interior Ministry officers, and we were not managing the situation there. But out of humanitarian considerations, it would be good if our human rights organisations got involved in this as well; we might ask Vladimir Lukin, either alone or together with his colleagues, representatives from France, Germany and Poland, with whom he participated in developing the well-known document of February 21, 2014, to go on location and see what is happening there with these Berkut officers, who have not broken any laws and acted in accordance with their orders. They are military service members, they stood there facing bullets, they were doused with fire and had Molotov cocktails thrown at them. They have been wounded and injured and are now in a hospital. It is even hard to imagine – even prisoners of war are being fed and treated. But they not only stopped treating them, they even stopped feeding them. And they have surrounded the building where these fighters’ families live and are bullying them. I think that human rights organisations must pay attention to this. And we, for our part, are ready to provide them with medical care here in Russia.
he US Secretary of State is certainly an important person, but he is not the ultimate authority that determines the United States’ foreign policy. We hear statements from various politicians and representatives of various political forces. This would be an extreme measure. If necessary, it will be used. But I really don’t want to use it, because I think Russia is not the only one interested in cooperation with its partners on an international level and in such areas as economy, politics and foreign security; our partners are just as interested in this cooperation. It is very easy to destroy these instruments of cooperation and it would be very difficult to rebuild them.
ou know, it is very hard for me to say; I have not analysed it carefully. I think he has no political future, and I have told him so. As for “getting involved in his fate” – we did this on purely humanitarian grounds. Death is the easiest way for getting rid of a legitimate president, and I think that is what would have happened. I think they would have simply killed him. Incidentally, the question arises: what for?
After all, look at how it all began, what triggered these events. The formal reason was that he did not sign the European Union Association Agreement. Today, this seems like nonsense; it is ridiculous to even talk about. But I want to point out that he did not refuse to sign the association agreement. He said: “We have carefully analysed it, and its content does not correspond with our national interests. We cannot sharply increase energy prices for our people, because our people are already in a rather difficult position. We cannot do this, and that, and that. We cannot immediately break our economic ties with Russia, because our cooperation is very extensive.”
I have already presented these figures: out of approximately 14 billion [dollars] in export, approximately 5 billion represents second and third technological processing level products exported to Russia. In other words, just about all engineering products are exported to Russia; the West is not buying any Ukrainian products. And to take all this and break it apart, to introduce European technical standards in the Ukrainian economy, which, thankfully or unfortunately, we are not using at the moment. We will adopt those standards at some point, but currently, we do not have those standards in Russia. This means the next day, our relations and cooperation ties will be broken, enterprises will come to a standstill and unemployment will increase. And what did Yanukovych say? He said, “I cannot do this so suddenly, let’s discuss this further.” He did not refuse to sign it, he asked for a chance to discuss this document some more, and then all this craziness began.
And why? Did he do something outside the scope of his authority? He acted absolutely within the scope of his authority; he did not infringe on anything. It was simply an excuse to support the forces opposing him in a fight for power. Overall, this is nothing special. But did it really need to be taken to this level of anarchy, to an unconstitutional overthrow and armed seizure of power, subsequently plunging the nation into the chaos where it finds itself today? I think this is unacceptable. And it is not the first time our Western partners are doing this in Ukraine. I sometimes get the feeling that somewhere across that huge puddle, in America, people sit in a lab and conduct experiments, as if with rats, without actually understanding the consequences of what they are doing. Why did they need to do this? Who can explain this? There is no explanation at all for it.
The same thing happened during the first Maidan uprising, when Yanukovych was blocked from power. Why did we need that third round of elections? In other words, it was turned into a farce – Ukraine’s political life was turned into a farce. There was no compliance with the Constitution at all. You see, we are now teaching people that if one person can violate any law, anyone else can do the same, and that’s what causes chaos. That is the danger. Instead, we need to teach our society to follow other traditions: traditions of respecting the main law of the nation, the Constitution, and all other laws. Of course, we will not always succeed, but I think acting like this – like a bull in a china shop is counterproductive and very dangerous.
Please.
s President, yes.
es.
isten, it seems like you didn’t hear what I have said. I already said that three days ago, I gave instructions to the Government to renew contacts at the government level with their colleagues in the corresponding ministries and departments in Ukraine, in order not to disrupt economic ties, to support them in their attempts to reconstruct the economy. Those were my direct instructions to the Russian Government. Moreover, Mr Medvedev is in contact with [Arseniy] Yatsenyuk. And I know that Sergei Naryshkin, as speaker of the Russian parliament, is in contact with [Oleksandr] Turchynov. But, I repeat, all our trade and economic and other ties, our humanitarian ties, can be developed in full only after the situation is normalised and presidential elections are held.
azprom could not have said that; you were not listening carefully or it did not express itself clearly. Gazprom is not reverting to the old prices. It simply does not want to extend the current discounts, which it had agreed to apply or not apply on a quarterly basis. Even before all these events, even before they hit the crisis point. I know about the negotiations between Gazprom and its partners. Gazprom and the Government of the Russian Federation agreed that Gazprom would introduce a discount by reducing gas prices to $268.50 per 1,000 cubic metres. The Government of Russia provides the first tranche of the loan, which is formally not a loan but a bond purchase – a quasi-loan, $3 billion dollars in the first stage. And the Ukrainian side undertakes to fully repay its debt that arose in the second half of last year and to make regular payments for what they are consuming – for the gas. The debt has not been repaid, regular payments are not being made in full.
Moreover, if the Ukrainian partners fail to make the February payment, the debt will grow even bigger. Today it is around $1.5–1.6 billion. And if they do not fully pay for February, it will be nearly $2 billion. Naturally, in these circumstances, Gazprom says, “Listen guys, since you don’t pay us anyway, and we are only seeing an increase in your debt, let’s lock into the regular price, which is still reduced.” This is a purely commercial component of Gazprom’s activities, which plans for revenues and expenditures in its investment plans like any other major company. If they do not receive the money from their Ukrainian partners on time, then they are undercutting their own investment programmes; this is a real problem for them. And incidentally, this does not have to do with the events in Ukraine or any politics. There was an agreement: “We give you money and reduced gas rates, and you give us regular payments.” They gave them money and reduced gas rates, but the payments are not being made. So naturally, Gazprom says, “Guys, that won’t work.”
 said that we have people who have the training and skills needed to be able to examine this issue and discuss it with our German colleagues. This is all possible. I gave the instruction accordingly to our Foreign Minister, who was to or will meet with the German Foreign Minister, Mr Steinmeier, yesterday or today to discuss this matter. 
o you think we have not made any response? I think we’ve just spent the last hour discussing this response. In some cases though, the developments taking place are unexpected in my view. I will not go into the specific details of what I am referring to here, but the reaction that we are seeing from people is understandable, in principle. Did our partners in the West and those who call themselves the government in Kiev now not foresee that events would take this turn? I said to them over and over: Why are you whipping the country into a frenzy like this? What are you doing? But they keep on pushing forward. Of course people in the eastern part of the country realise that they have been left out of the decision-making process.
Essentially, what is needed now is to adopt a new constitution and put it to a referendum so that all of Ukraine’s citizens can take part in the process and influence the choice of basic principles that will form the foundations of their country’s government. But this is not our affair of course. This is something for the Ukrainian people and the Ukrainian authorities to decided one way or another. I think that once a legitimate government is in place and a new president and parliament are elected, which is what is planned, this will probably go ahead. If I were them, I would return to the matter of adopting a constitution and, as I said, putting it to a referendum so that everyone can have their say on it, cast their vote, and then everyone will have to respect it. If people feel they are left out of this process, they will never agree with it and will keep on fighting it. Who needs this kind of thing? But as I said, this is all not our affair. 
Let’s see how it goes. If it is accompanied by the same kind of terror that we are seeing now in Kiev, we will not recognise it.
I don’t know, I think it would be the height of cynicism to put the Paralympics at risk. We all know that this is an international sports event at which people with disabilities can show their capabilities, prove to themselves and the entire world that they are not people with limitations, but on the contrary, people with unlimited possibilities, and demonstrate their achievements in sport. If there are people ready to try to disrupt this event, it would show that these are people for whom there really is nothing sacred. 
Before making public statements, and all the more so before taking practical steps, we give issues due thought and attention and try to foresee the consequences and reactions that the various potential players could have.
As for the Memorandum that you mentioned, you said you are from Reuters, is that right?
How do the public and political circles in your country view these events that have taken place? It is clear after all that this was an armed seizure of power. That is a clear and evident fact. And it is clear too that this goes against the Constitution. That is also a clear fact, is it not? 
ood on you! You should join the diplomatic service; you’d make a good diplomat. Diplomats’ tongues, as we know, are there to hide their thoughts. So, we say that what we are seeing is an anti-constitutional coup, and we get told, no, it isn’t. You have probably heard plenty of times now that this was not an anti-constitutional coup and not an armed seizure of power, but a revolution. Have you heard this? 
es, but if this is revolution, what does this mean? In such a case it is hard not to agree with some of our experts who say that a new state is now emerging in this territory. This is just like what happened when the Russian Empire collapsed after the 1917 revolution and a new state emerged. And this would be a new state with which we have signed no binding agreements.
To answer your question, we are in principle ready to look at taking the steps needed to make the other tranches available with regard to the purchase of bonds. But our Western partners have asked us not to do this. They have asked us to work together through the IMF to encourage the Ukrainian authorities to carry out the reforms needed to bring about recovery in the Ukrainian economy. We will continue working in this direction. But given that Naftogaz of Ukraine is not paying Gazprom now, the Government is considering various options.
Overall, I think it is gradually starting to level out. We absolutely must send the signal to people in Ukraine’s southeast that they can feel safe, and know that they will be able to take part in the general political process of stabilising the country. 
To be honest, I really don’t know.
I really can’t say. You know, it’s hard to make predictions after events of this kind. I have already said that I do not agree with this method of taking power and removing the incumbent authorities and president, and I strongly oppose this kind of method in Ukraine and in the post-Soviet area in general. I oppose this because this kind of method does not inculcate legal culture, respect for the law. If one person can get away with doing this, it means that everyone is allowed to try, and this only means chaos. You have to understand that this kind of chaos is the worst possible thing for countries with a shaky economy and unstable political system. In this kind of situation you never know what kind of people events will bring to the fore. Just recall, for example, the role that [Ernst] Roehm’s storm troopers played during Hitler’s rise to power. Later, these storm troopers were liquidated, but they played their part in bringing Hitler to power. Events can take all kinds of unexpected turns. 
Let me say again that in situations when people call for fundamental political reform and new faces at the top, and with full justification too – and in this I agree with the Maidan – there is a risk too that you’ll suddenly get some upstart nationalist or semi-fascist lot sprout up, like the genie suddenly let out of the bottle – and we see them today, people wearing armbands with something resembling swastikas, still roaming around Kiev at this moment – or some anti-Semite or other. This danger is there too.
We need to have contact with everyone except for obvious criminals, but as I said, in this kind of situation, there is always the risk that events of this kind will bring people with extreme views to the fore, and this of course has serious consequences for the country.
s you know, we always worked quite productively with all of the different Ukrainian governments, no matter what their political colour. We worked with Leonid Kuchma, and with [Viktor] Yushchenko. When I was Prime Minister, I worked with Tymoshenko. I visited her in Ukraine and she came here to Russia. We had to deal with all kinds of different situations in our work to manage our countries’ economies. We had our differences, but we also reached agreements. Overall it was constructive work. If she wants to come to Russia, let her come. It’s another matter that she is no longer prime minister now. In what capacity will she come? But I personally have no intention of stopping her from coming to Russia.
As I said before, I think this was a well-prepared action. Of course there were combat detachments. They are still there, and we all saw how efficiently they worked. Their Western instructors tried hard of course. But this is not the real problem. If the Ukrainian government had been strong, confident, and had built a stable system, no nationalists would have been able to carry out those programs and achieve the results that we see now. 
The real problem is that none of the previous Ukrainian governments gave proper attention to people’s needs. Here in Russia we have many problems, and many of them are similar to those in Ukraine, but they are not as serious as in Ukraine. Average per capita [monthly] income in Russia, for example, is 29,700 rubles, but in Ukraine, if we convert it into rubles, it is 11,900 rubles, I think – almost three times lower than in Russia. The average pension in Russia is 10,700 rubles, but in Ukraine it is 5,500 rubles – twice lower than in Russia. Great Patriotic War veterans in Russia receive almost as much as the average worker each month. In other words, there is a substantial difference in living standards. This was what the various governments should have been focusing on right from the start. Of course they needed to fight crime, nepotism, clans and so on, especially in the economy. People see what is going on, and this creates lack of confidence in the authorities. 
This has continued as several generations of modern Ukrainian politicians have come and gone, and the ultimate result is that people are disappointed and want to see a new system and new people in power. This was the main source of fuel for the events that took place. But let me say again: a change of power, judging by the whole situation, was probably necessary in Ukraine, but it should have taken place only through legitimate means, in respect for and not in violation of the current Constitution. 
You can never use the conditional mood in politics. I will stick to that rule.
I have seen him once since he arrived in Russia. That was just two days ago. He was alive and well and wishes you the same. He’ll still have a chance of catching a cold at the funeral of those who are spreading these rumours of his demise. 
I would rather not answer this question, not because I do not have an opinion to express, but because I do not think it would be proper on my part. You have to understand, after all…
No, I have completely different feelings. Anyone in this office bears an enormous responsibility on their shoulders as head of state, and they have rights and also obligations. But the biggest obligation of all is to carry out the will of the people who have entrusted you with the country, acting within the law. And so we need to analyse, did he do everything that the law and the voters’ mandate empowered him to do? You can analyse this yourselves and draw your own conclusions.
et’s talk later.
e need to make our position clear to everyone, really.
We need to be heard by all of Ukraine’s people. We have no enemies in Ukraine. Let me say again that Ukraine is a friendly country. Do you know how many people came from Ukraine to Russia last year? 3.3 million came, and of that number almost 3 million people came to Russia for work. These people are working here – around 3 million people. Do you know how much money they send back home to Ukraine to support their families? Count up the average wage of 3 million people. This comes to billions of dollars and makes a big contribution to Ukraine’s GDP. This is no joking matter. We welcome all of them, and among the people coming here to work are also many from western Ukraine. They are all equal in our eyes, all brothers to us. 
Our position is that if the people who call themselves the government now hope to be considered a civilised government, they must ensure the safety of all of their citizens, no matter in which part of the country, and we of course will follow this situation closely. 
Thank you.
"
2013-12-17," Mr Yanukovych,
It gives me great pleasure to welcome you to Moscow. This is a regular meeting scheduled to take place prior to the interstate consultations, and I very much hope that we can move forward in addressing the most important issues.
There can be no doubt that Ukraine is our strategic partner and ally in the fullest sense of the word. Unfortunately, as we noted during our recent meeting in Sochi, we have seen a decrease in trade over the past two years: 11 percent in 2012 and a further 14.5 percent this year. Therefore, it is time to take vigorous action so that we not only return to the level of previous years, but also create the conditions for moving forward.
Lately, our colleagues in the Government – the prime ministers and other members of our countries’ cabinets – have been working very successfully in several vitally important sectors, including energy, machine engineering, space, aviation and shipbuilding. I know that you have been briefed on the results of their work. Today we will have an excellent chance to strengthen our legal base in in these areas, and to create all the conditions necessary for expanding trade and economic relations between Russia and Ukraine.
I am very pleased to see you. Welcome!
"
2013-07-28," Mr Yanukovych, sailors and officers, admirals and generals, veterans,
I congratulate all of you on Russian Navy Day and Ukrainian Navy Day.
We are celebrating this important holiday together today, and it is symbolic that Sevastopol is the centre of the celebrations. It was here, in the Bay of Akhtiar, that the Black Sea squadron’s base was founded 230 years ago. 
Sevastopol has since grown into a large and beautiful city, a legendary hero-city that bears the unfading legacy of our military glory, the place where a brotherhood of arms was forged between our peoples, and where pages in our common history were written, in which the navy always played a big part. 
We are deservedly proud of our Black Sea Fleet. Its sailors fought bravely in the Russo-Turkish and Crimean wars, took part in the heroic campaigns led by Fyodor Ushakov, and gave their utmost in the fight against the Nazis during the Great Patriotic War.
Courage, honour, and loyalty to their duty as soldiers and their battle traditions are what always distinguished the sailors and what they have handed down from generation to the next. 
Today, you join the parade as a single force, symbolising our ancestors’ strength and loyalty to their foundations. Our forebears lived for centuries together, worked together, defended their common homeland and made it strong, great and invincible. 
We have common roots, a common culture and religion. We can feel this shared legacy especially strongly over these days as our countries celebrate the 1025th anniversary of the Baptism of Holy Rus. Our blood and spiritual ties are unbreakable. 
Once again, I congratulate all the sailors on this holiday, those here at the parade ground and those out in the harbour or off on missions, and our dear veterans too of course.
I congratulate all Sevastopol residents, everyone living in this city that history has made a sacred and unbreakable link in the brotherhood between our peoples. 
I wish you health, prosperity, and good fortune.
Glory to the sailors of Russia and Ukraine!
"
2013-07-27," Good afternoon, friends,
I just said goodbye before to President of Ukraine Mr Yanukovych. You also sent him your best wishes. Unfortunately, he has a strict schedule with a lot of events to attend: meetings with colleagues, with state leaders here for the celebrations of the 1025th anniversary of the Baptism of Rus. As I understand, these circumstances are in large part behind your meeting today.
It is a great pleasure to greet you. As your agenda and your main programme outlines state, you are here to discuss the significance of Ukraine’s civilisational choice. This is not just Ukraine’s civilisational choice. Here at this site, at the baptismal site on the Dnieper River, a choice was made for the whole of Holy Rus, for all of us. Our ancestors who lived in these lands made this choice for our entire people. When I say “for our entire people”, we know today’s reality of course, know that there are the Ukrainian people and the Belarusian people, and other peoples too, and we respect all the parts of this heritage, but at the same time, at the foundations of this heritage are the common spiritual values that make us a single people. The Ukrainian Orthodox Church leaders spoke about this today. It would be hard to deny this. We can only agree with it.
The Baptism of Rus was a great event that defined Russia’s and Ukraine’s spiritual and cultural development for the centuries to come. We must remember this brotherhood and preserve our ancestors’ traditions. Together, they built a unique system of Orthodox values and strengthened themselves in their faith.
Ukraine, like Russia, has not had an easy history. In mediaeval times, Ukraine was part of first one and then another European power centre, came under the rule of one country, then another. But the vision of uniting both the western and eastern parts of Rus, the state that had its beginnings here in Kiev, at this baptismal site on the Dnieper, always lived on in the east and in the west, wherever our people lived. The unity of east and west changed the lives of Ukraine’s population and its elite for the better, as everyone knows. Starting from the 18th century, natives of Kiev and Lviv were prominent in Russia’s science, literary, and church circles.
Before the Russian empress issued a special decree, the decree in effect, as I mentioned earlier at the Kiev Pechersk Lavra, was the Spiritual Regulation issued by Peter the Great in 1721. Bishops’ houses opened theological schools that made an enormous contribution to the Russian people’s education. In accordance with Peter the Great’s decree, the heads of these schools were all from Ukraine. This recognised the common spiritual source that began here. Many Ukrainians were also active in diplomatic and senior civil service in Russia, abroad and in the central government bodies.
After its reunification with Russia, Ukraine developed very rapidly in the 17–18th centuries. It became Russia’s breadbasket. By the end of the 19th century, the Donetsk Basin had become one of Russia’s main mining and metals industry regions, and Odessa was one of the Russian Empire’s biggest seaports. 
”The Baptism of Rus was a great event that defined Russia’s and Ukraine’s spiritual and cultural development for the centuries to come. We must remember this brotherhood and preserve our ancestors’ traditions.“
By the late 19th century, Ukraine had a dense railway network. It became one of the big industrial development centres after the reforms of 1861. In just two decades, coal production increased 13-fold, and iron ore production increased by a mighty 158-fold. This was Ukraine’s economic boom. Ukraine produced double the amount of cast iron as the Urals at the end of the 19th century. It was also one of the main centres for transport and agricultural machine-building, producing 30–40 percent of the total national volume of goods in these sectors.
Ukraine’s people played an active part in the Russian Empire’s economic and cultural life. Kiev essentially became the second cultural and scientific capital after St Petersburg. People from Ukraine were very active in developing Siberia. Of the 2.5 million people who resettled in Siberia over 1906–1912, around 1 million came from Ukraine. Today, there are many Ukrainians living in every town and village throughout Siberia.
During the Soviet period, Ukraine had the highest technological and industrial development level of the Soviet republics. It received more than 20 percent of total investment during the first five-year plan. Four hundred of the 1,500 new industrial enterprises created were in Ukraine, including such giants as Zaporozhstal, Kommunar, Krivorozhstal, Azovstal, DneproGES, aluminium smelters, the Kharkov Tractor Factory, and the Lugansk Locomotive Factory. The industrialisation programme put Ukraine ahead of many Western European countries in the heavy industry sector. It was second in Europe after Germany for cast iron production, was in fourth place for coal production, and was ahead of France and Italy and caught up to Britain in the metals and automotive industries. And this was counting only Ukraine on its own!
No effort was spared to rebuild Ukraine after the Great Patriotic War. By 1950, Ukraine was producing more ferrous metals, iron ore, electricity, mineral fertilisers and other important industrial goods than before the war. Gross industrial production was 15 percent higher than the pre-war 1940 figure. It was a whole 44 percent higher in machine-building and metals processing, and 2.3 times higher in production of industrial construction materials. Ukraine’s average annual industrial growth rate was nearly 1.5 times higher than the national average. 
Ukraine produced around 48 percent of total Soviet steel output, 33 percent of rolled steel, 53 percent of iron ore, 30 percent of coal, 38 percent of metal-cutting tools, and 71 percent of sugar. It really was an economic and industrial giant. By 1960, industrial output in Ukraine had increased more than 3.6-fold compared to 1940. Labour productivity – an important indicator in any economy, including a market economy – grew by more than 2.5-fold over this period. In 1965, Ukraine’s industrial production was 5.6 times higher than the 1940 level.
Ukraine became a leader in developing advanced technology in the 1970s. You know this better than I. Aircraft-manufacturing, the rocket and space sector, nuclear machine-building, instrument-making industry, shipbuilding, electrical technology – all of it was here. The development levels of sea, rail, and pipeline transport systems were among the highest in the Soviet Union.
”Competition on the global markets is very fierce today. Only by joining forces we can be competitive and stand a chance of winning in this tough environment. We have every reason too, to be confident that we should and can achieve this.“
People’s incomes and living standards increased dramatically over this period. Western estimates show that Ukraine’s per capita income in 1970 was higher than in a developed European country such as Italy.
We all know what happened after the Soviet Union’s collapse. I will not pass any political judgements on those events. We live in different countries today, but this fact in no way crosses out the common historic past that we share, and that is our asset and the foundation upon which we can build new integration ties. We are fortunate to still have a common transport and energy system, a common electricity system, and we have deep-reaching cooperation in many important economic sectors. This cooperation is vital for the effective development of the enterprises involved and indeed of entire economic sectors
Competition on the global markets is very fierce today. I am sure that most of you realise that only by joining forces can we be competitive and stand a chance of winning in this tough environment. We have every reason too, to be confident that we should and can achieve this. 
As you know, there are various integration processes underway now in the post-Soviet area. Much has already been said about the depth and benefits of this integration, and I won’t repeat this now. We will respect whatever choice the Ukrainian government and people make on the depth of Ukraine’s engagement in these processes in the post-Soviet area. But there are facts that speak for themselves. Our bilateral trade with Ukraine fell by slightly over 18 percent in the first quarter of this year. Our trade with the Customs Union countries increased by 34 percent in 2011, by 11 percent, I think, in 2012, and was up by 2 or 3 percent in the first quarter of this year, despite the downturn in the global economy. We have steady growth.
Let me say again that we will respect whatever choice our Ukrainian partners, friends and brothers make. The question is only one of how we go about agreeing on working together under absolutely equal, transparent and clear conditions. 
I know how hard you are working on searching for the best possible forms of cooperation between Russia and Ukraine. I thank you sincerely for these efforts and wish you success.
Thank you very much.

2013-07-27,"our Holiness, Your Beatitude, Your Eminence, friends,
I am very happy to meet with the hierarchs of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church. I have warm recollections of our last meeting; it occurred ten years ago here, at Kiev Pechersk Lavra. But today’s meeting has special significance. It is being held during the days when Russia, Ukraine and Belarus are jointly celebrating an important date: the 1025th anniversary of the Baptism of Rus. This is a shared celebration for our brotherly peoples and an important event for Orthodox Christians around the world.
Two days ago, I met with the primates and heads of delegations from all localOrthodox churches at the Moscow Kremlin, and we discussed this matter at length.
Strong humanitarian and spiritual ties are a firm foundation for Russian-Ukrainian friendship. It has been built over the course of many centuries, and together, we have lived through the most difficult trials, tribulations and tragedies. But we were also together as we built and protected our common Fatherland, Great Rus, maintaining our faith, our unique historical experience and our destiny. This is due largely to the entire Russian Orthodox Church. On this festive day, I am particularly pleased to fulfil the honourable mission of the Russian government and present you with state decorations – you, the hierarchs of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate.
”Strong humanitarian and spiritual ties are a firm foundation for Russian-Ukrainian friendship. It has been built over the course of many centuries, and together, we have lived through the most difficult trials, tribulations and tragedies. But we were also together as we built and protected our common Fatherland, Great Rus.“
During the most difficult times, you have unfailingly demonstrated bravery and spiritual strength. You did much to maintain canonical unity, uniting people from different ethnic groups. These state decorations are a symbol of genuine gratitude for your input into strengthening peace, harmony and spiritual renewal in our nations.
I sincerely wish you health and success in this noble service, and I want to thank you once again for your wisdom and selflessness, which are so greatly needed not just by the citizens of Russia and Ukraine, but by all Orthodox peoples. Thank you very much.
I will say a few more words informally about today’s visit.
I must state from the outset that we have very friendly, close, business-oriented relations with Ukraine’s leadership. But today’s visit was linked first and foremost with our common celebration, the 1025th anniversary of the Baptism of Rus. Indeed, this is the main goal of our visit to Ukraine, to Kiev, today. For any person who feels a spiritual connection to the Dnieper, Kiev baptistery, it is a special kind of pleasure and a special honour to touch these relics, worship them.
I would like to once again thank you all for serving as true guardians of this common spiritual heritage, which is so important to us – and not just to us, but to all people who honour these values.
In today’s world, when we come across various points of view on how the world should develop and the values it should draw upon, your service and your role in maintaining these moral foundations is invaluable. We are aware that this service is difficult, that this fate is difficult, and for that, we want to truly thank you.
our Holiness, your Beatitude, hierarchs of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church,
Please let me sincerely congratulate you on receiving Russian state decorations and allow me to recall, as was said earlier, our common history, which began so long ago. Our spiritual unity began with the Baptism of Holy Rus 1025 years ago. Since then, much has happened in the lives of our peoples, but our spiritual unity is so strong that it is not subject to any action by any authority: neither government authorities nor, I would even go so far as to say, church authorities. Because regardless of any existing authority over the people, there can be none that is stronger than the authority of the Lord – nothing can be stronger than that. And this is the most solid foundation for our unity in the souls of our people.
There were different attitudes from the part of our government towards Orthodox Christians in our nation, but during these festive, celebratory days, let me speak of the good times only. One such good periodwas Peter the Great’s decree of 1721, when theological schools were established at every episcopacy across Russia and the teachers at these schools all came from Ukraine – all of them – this was the general rule introduced by Peter the Great’s decree. And I suppose this was no accident; I imagine it was precisely because, as I already said, the Dnieper, Kiev baptistery is our common spiritual basis.
I want to once again congratulate everyone on this great event, the Baptism of Rus, and wish you all success. Thank you very much.
"
2013-07-27,"r Yanukovych, friends,
First of all, I am grateful to the President of Ukraine for his invitation to participate in celebrations of the 1025th anniversary of the Baptism of Rus and I thank you for today’s opportunity to meet with you.
This is truly our shared major holiday, which reminds us of our spiritual unity and our common roots. It reminds us that we have done a great deal together during previous centuries and that together, we achieved genuinely outstanding results in building what was then our common Fatherland, developing our territories, our nations, our peoples.
”We are full of resolve to work together, drawing on everything that has been achieved by our forefathers and our predecessors.“
Today, the situation is different, but we are full of resolve to work together, drawing on everything that has been achieved by our forefathers and our predecessors. The challenges before us are large and difficult. I am pleased to note that you and I maintain a constant personal contact: you come to our nation on working visits and I come to Ukraine – today’s meeting is yet another confirmation of this. There are on-going meetings between our colleagues at the government and representative body level. We have many joint issues and problems that we must resolve.
Tomorrow, we will be observing Navy Day, another celebration that, thanks to you, has also become a shared one. I hope it will be another good cause to talk about cooperation in the security sector: it is an area where our nations face many threats and challenges.
I am very pleased by our meeting today, and I thank you again for inviting me.
<…>
"
2013-05-26,"Mr President, it is a great pleasure to see you and to have this chance to discuss in an informal setting our bilateral relations, trade and economic ties, and our cooperation in the CIS   Background information Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)   .
We have a traditionally broad range of ties that cover political contacts, economic relations and humanitarian cooperation. As we always say in such situations, we have plenty to discuss.
I am very happy to see you. Thank you for accepting our invitation and coming here. It makes me very happy that you were able to find time on a weekend to come. It is a pleasure to see you. Welcome!
Nearly every day.
Thank you. It is good to hear that you had the chance to see for yourself the scale of all the work underway here in Sochi.
Of course, this creates some problems for the people here at the moment, especially for holidaymakers and city residents, but our hope is that when all of this is finished, people will feel the benefits and will be proud that they live in or come to enjoy the services of a world-class resort town that works effectively and can take people winter or summer. 
This is thus a project designed not just for the present, but for future generations too. I will tell you in more detail about everything we are doing here.
<…>
"
2013-03-04,"r President, I am very happy to see you!
You and I meet regularly, and our colleagues work at almost every level – at ministerial and expert level, on foreign policy and economic matters.
Unfortunately, we have seen a small drop in trade turnover. The year before last, it was a little over 50 billion, but last year, it was only 45 billion. Nevertheless, we have good projects in various areas, including high-tech ones such as aerospace and aircraft industry. We are developing contacts in the energy sector, including nuclear energy.
Of course, we have some problems, there are problematic issues, but overall, our work is progressing successfully. I am very happy to have this opportunity to meet with you and exchange views regarding the hurdles in our cooperation and the things that need to be done in order for it develop more quickly.
I am very happy to see you. Welcome!
e can hold it any place you like, anywhere you would like to go.
hat’s very true.
r Yanukovych touched on this topic on his own initiative. We will surely discuss it. We do not have any restricted topics; we discuss everything, including gas, nuclear energy and engineering. Mr Yanukovych mentioned nearly all the topics, including integration processes in the post-Soviet space.
Last year, we signed an Agreement on a free trade zone in the CIS. Ukraine had insisted on it earlier. We worked together for a long time, but overall, we met halfway and signed it.
As for the Customs Union, our experts and the Ukrainian National Academy of Sciences’ Institute for Economics and Forecasting came to the conclusion that if Ukraine were to join the Customs Union, its GDP growth rate would be between 1.5 and 6.5 percent, depending on the depth of integration.
Mr Yanukovych just mentioned the problems. The more tightly we work with Kazakhstan and Belarus, the more difficult it will be for Ukraine to enter our markets with its traditional goods. Clearly, the President of Ukraine is concerned by this.
Beginning in 2015, we will be restricting workforce movement from nations other than the Customs Union. We have already declared this publicly. Today’s preferential conditions for workforce movement will apply only to the Customs Union nations. Naturally, this is of concern to us – to Russia and to Ukraine.
Together, we will need to think about how to avoid these negative things and do everything to ensure there is no deterioration and that on the contrary, as Mr Yanukovych said, we move forward as regards the challenges we face in the global economy.
 fully support what Mr Yanukovych just said. I just want to note that in the Customs Union, we resolve nearly all issues by consensus – at least the key ones. We have built everything exclusively on the basis of taking into account the interests of all three parties, so this process is difficult and requires the participation by Belarus and Kazakhstan.
In terms of socioeconomic aspects, I think that today there are no serious experts either in Ukraine or in Russia who do not believe that this experience is absolutely positive for Ukraine. And as the President of Ukraine said, at this time, the issue lies in political plane – it is a political issue, a political choice for Ukraine itself. And we will certainly respect whatever choice is made.
Thank you.
"
2012-10-22,"adies and gentlemen, colleagues,
Our meeting with President of Ukraine, Mr Yanukovych, was held in a business-like, friendly, honest atmosphere, as is typical for us.
Our talks confirmed that the development of cooperation and partnership between Russia and Ukraine is our common, strategic choice. It is based, first and foremost, on the strong bonds of friendship between our peoples, and regardless of the political situation, there is no reasonable alternative to this course.
This is clear in the example of Russian-Ukrainian economic ties: many sectors of our industry are interdependent and complementary, with thousands of companies and enterprises working directly within the production cooperation framework.
Today, Ukraine is firmly in fourth place among Russia’s main foreign trade partners, and the first among CIS   Background information Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)    nations. Last year, our mutual trade turnover grew by 36 percent, surpassing $50 billion. We need to maintain and consolidate this trend.
We discussed the additional reserves that can be used to achieve this and how to reduce our economies’ dependence on the complicated processes that are underway in the global economy, on global markets.
Given the high degree of integration between our economies, we will work more actively on projects in areas where Russia and Ukraine are truly leaders. I am referring to nuclear energy, aircraft manufacturing, metallurgy and aerospace. A concrete step taken in this direction is the protocol signed today on the supply of goods within the production cooperation framework. It is about simplifying the procedures for reciprocal delivery of component parts, materials and equipment in sectors where we are building common production chains as much as possible.
Broadening investment, trade and industrial ties would help to remove barriers hindering the movement of goods and services, capital and labour. So during the talks, we also touched on the important topic of Ukraine’s participation in integration processes underway in the CIS.
”The development of cooperation and partnership between Russia and Ukraine is our common, strategic choice. It is based on the strong bonds of friendship between our peoples.“
Ukraine was one of the first nations to ratify the CIS Free Trade Zone Agreement. In doing so, we perceive Ukraine as a country with a pragmatic attitude toward strengthening and promoting cooperation and integration.
We also discussed humanitarian issues. The Days of Education and Science of the Russian Federation were successfully held one month ago in Kiev. They included presentations of Russia’s leading universities, the latest achievements from Russian educators, and new educational programmes. There was a useful exchange of experience. Another important joint project will be the 200th anniversary of the birth of the great poet Taras Shevchenko in 2014. The President of Ukraine and I agreed to give instructions to our respective governments to begin joint all-around preparations for this anniversary, which is significant to both our nations.
In conclusion, I would like to say the following: the parliamentary election campaign is wrapping up in Ukraine, and we sincerely hope that the elections to the Verkhovna Rada will ensure further steady democratic development of the brotherly Ukrainian nation. We hope that after the election, the course toward close cooperation between our nations will gain additional momentum.
I would like to thank Mr Yanukovych and all our Ukrainian friends for their constructive approach to all the issues we discussed.
"
2012-10-22," Mr President,
It is a great pleasure to see you. Thank you for accepting the invitation and coming for this visit. There is no need to repeat what we all know about the immense scale of our cooperation, which is developing well in our political ties, in international affairs, and in the economy too. Our bilateral trade is growing and our ties continue to become more diversified. The deep level of cooperation between our companies is well known and I have already spoken about it. There are some companies in both countries that simply would not be able to work effectively without each other.
I think your visit is timely. I am very pleased that we have these regular contacts, not just at the presidential level, but at the government and ministerial level too, and between our companies that work together.
I am very happy to see you and wish you welcome.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for your congratulations and for the deep analysis of our relations.
On the Customs Union, as we have discussed before, it is always up to each country to decide for itself whether to join this or that organisation. But given the depth of our cooperation, including in the key sectors you listed just now such as nuclear energy, the energy sector in general, aircraft manufacturing, space sector, shipbuilding, and other important sectors that characterise an economy’s level of technological development in general, not to mention joint scientific research and so on, we should analyse things in terms of a single comprehensive whole.
You have to look too at the markets our countries work on. Ukrainian goods play an undisputed priority role in a number of sectors on the Russian market. You export a large share of your produce and a lot of aviation equipment to Russia. Almost all Russian helicopters are fitted with Ukrainian-made engines, for example.
nd there are other areas of cooperation in the aircraft-manufacturing sector too.
This is all so important for future development of both economies that it is only natural to put in place special conditions for developing these cooperation ties. But this is a process of negotiations of course. I have been discussing it with my colleagues too, as you know, — with the President of Kazakhstan and with the President of Belarus. This is a reciprocal process and must go hand-in-hand with a deep analysis of our mutual interests, and take these interests into account. 
We will discuss this today too.
Yes, and the gas sector too.
<…>
"
2012-08-25,"Good afternoon, Mr Yanukovych. Thank you for agreeing to come to Russia for these working consultations.
As you know, Russia has become a full member of the World Trade Organisation, which Ukraine joined some time ago. In addition, we have agreed to and created a free trade zone within the CIS   Background information Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)   . I am confident that all of this will allow us to expand trade and economic ties, which already have great importance both for Russia and Ukraine.
I think it is no secret that the Russian Federation is the biggest market for Ukrainian goods. I'm not even talking about agriculture. I do not know the exact figures but about 80% of Ukraine’s agricultural exports are sold to Russia.
However, our cooperation in high technology, including such sectors as nuclear energy, space, shipbuilding, aviation and engine-building, is very far-reaching, and it would probably be extremely difficult, to put it mildly, for these industries in our countries to exist without each other. Russia is without doubt the main market for aircraft and helicopter engines. In fact Ukraine probably exports to Russia close to 100% of everything that these industries produce.
Cooperation between our countries goes far back and is very productive. New instruments have made it possible to expand our ties. I am very glad that today we will have an opportunity to discuss all these issues informally.
You have mentioned the Asian aspect of our cooperation. I know and you have just said it yourself that Ukraine is looking for opportunities to expand its export markets, including by building ties with the dynamically developing Asian market.
Russia will host the APEC summit in the near future, which will be a summit of all the states with a coastline on the Pacific Ocean. We will be happy to inform you in detail about all the prospects and opportunities.
In fact, I think that if we were able to grant Ukraine observer status in this very important international forum, it would be useful for both the Russian and the Ukrainian economy. Let's talk about that today, too.
<…>
"
2012-07-12,"r Yanukovych, friends,
Please allow me to begin by sincerely thanking Mr Yanukovych for his initiative to meet here in Crimea today. Our large Interstate Commission has not gathered in this format in a long time – over two years. There were objective reasons for this. Now, the situation has changed, and indeed, we are prepared to take our level of cooperation to new heights.
An enormous work has been done by our colleagues, including many who are present. On June 27, a meeting between heads of government was held in Kiev and the committee on economic issues prepared a whole set of suggestions and projects that we can and should promote.
Mr Yanukovych already noted that we consider trade and economic cooperation to be most important. We mentioned during a one-on-one conversation, as I already said, that Ukraine plays an important role in Russia’s trade and economic ties and accounts for over six percent – 6.2 percent – of Russia’s overall volume in trade and economic ties.
This is a lot, and if we take into account deep cooperation between our industries, we can see that these are not just figures and percentages; indeed, they are evidence of the qualitative coordination between our largest companies and whole sectors of the economy.
Naturally, we will also talk today about our cooperation in the military technology sector; here, too, we have many opportunities. Some very practical work is already underway.
Russia serves as a traditional sales market for military products from many Ukrainian companies, just as some of our sectors depend on our Ukrainian partners.
But we will need to talk about our plans in the military technology sector in great detail, because it affects not just the state of our Armed Forces, but also the state of high-tech sectors of the economy such as aviation, air and space, and shipbuilding.
Granted, each of these matters has its own independent significance, unrelated to military cooperation. In terms of military cooperation, of course, we will also talk about our agreements on the Russian Navy’s presence in Crimea.
The humanitarian component is another important aspect of our joint work. It includes language, culture, cultural exchanges in the broadest sense of the word. I don’t think there is any need for me to tell you how much respect and interest the people of Russia feel toward Ukrainian language, Ukrainian culture and Ukrainian traditions.
We have three million Ukrainians residing in Russia. But this is not just about the three million ethnic Ukrainians. It is about the fact that there are very many friendly personal ties between our nations. If we take into account that those three million Ukrainians in Russia also have spouses and children, than that increases the number at least two- or three-fold. The traditional, historic ties between Russia and Ukraine absolutely necessitate that we give significant attention to those humanitarian aspects.
Ukraine and Russia are very reliable partners in the international arena. In 2013, Ukraine will chair the OSCE and naturally, we would also like to talk about our priorities, to hear about your priorities and to discuss our involvement in the respective activities in light of Ukraine’s vision.
Of course, this is not a full list of the issues that we plan to discuss today.
Thank you for your attention.
"
2012-07-12,"They are expecting you, too.
I told them that the last time we met you suggested that we get on our bikes, remember the old days and ride over.
Mr Yanukovych, we can work as long as we need to.
Thank you very much. First of all, thank you for the invitation. We have been planning this meeting and our joint work for a long time.
As you know, I am accompanied today by a very big and highly representative Russian leadership team. It includes ministers in charge of various fields, primarily the economic bloc, but not exclusively. We have a great deal to discuss.
I fully agree with your assessment of the positive trends in trade and the economy, which have posted very good growth. Ukraine occupies approximately 6.2% of Russia's trade. That is a very impressive figure.
I believe Ukraine is in the fifth place among our major trade partners, and we will do our best to make a quick recovery from the minor setback we experienced in the first quarter of 2012, as you have said.
I think this should also be one of the subjects we discuss today. Let’s talk about it, analyse the processes that are taking place and the way they are unfolding. I am absolutely confident that this year our results will be as good as last years’, and perhaps even better.
Apart form these issues, we have many other matters of mutual interest. I am referring to a number of major projects that are being planned and which will certainly be realised, I have no doubt about that.
We will work as long as you consider necessary.
"
2012-05-15,"r Yanukovych, colleagues,
I am very happy for the opportunity to speak with you – within the framework of this informal meeting of CIS heads of state – about our bilateral relations, relations that have never been interrupted. These relations were never disrupted on a personal level, and certainly not on an interstate level.
At the same time, I want to note that recently, we have done a lot to develop bilateral ties. It is enough to say that in the last year, the growth rates for turnover between Russia and Ukraine have been much higher than the growth rate for economic ties between Russia and other nations. The turnover grew by more than 40 per cent and we achieved good results in absolute terms: trade turnover amounted to over $50 billion. Two years ago, Ukraine ranked fifth in terms of turnover with Russia, but last year’s data puts it in fourth place. Only China, Germany and the Netherlands have higher figures. This is a very good indicator. I hope that we will do everything so that these positive trends are maintained in the future.
“We have done a great deal of work on the integration track and agreed on a free trade zone. I think we now need to move toward ratification.”
e have done a great deal of work on the integration track and agreed on a free trade zone. I think we now need to move toward ratification. I know we feel the same on this issue. I hope this will be true for all participating nations.
As for other areas, in order to become stronger (you know my position), we need to achieve a greater degree of integration, and this, of course, is the sovereign decision of each of our partners. I hope that today, we will also be able to discuss this in more detail.
